# Preamble

Memory, knowledge, lives, even identities, all is distributed. We are socially fragmented. It could be used as an argument for a non-local consciousness theory. Therefore, with this text, I am just trying to compile pieces of what I have been in order to know a bit better what I am know. I have been told in the past that there is wisdom in the text that I wrote, and I am certainly sure that there is wisdom in the texts that I received. I hope you find something that makes your life more meaningful and satisfactory. I hope you find on some of these words a bunch of human beings that, like you, have suffered and have enjoyed moments of their lives.

Wish you the best, 

Carlito Fluito, a.k.a. Carlos Alcalá
