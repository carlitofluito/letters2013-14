# Preamble

We are socially fragmented. 

Memory, knowledge, lives, even identities. Everything is dispersed (another argument supporting the non-local consciousness theory). 

The aim of this epistolary work is to know a bit better what I am now thorugh the compilation of pieces of what I have been. I have been told in the past that there was wisdom in the texts I wrote, and I am sure that there is wisdom in the texts I received. 
I hope you find something that makes your life more meaningful and satisfactory. I hope you find a bunch of human beings that, like you, have suffered and have enjoyed moments of their lives. A bunch of human beings that, after all, have lived.

Wish you the best, 

Carlito Fluito, a.k.a. Carlos Alcal√°
