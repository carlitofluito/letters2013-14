# Preamble {-#preamble}

We are socially fragmented. 

Memory, knowledge, lives, even identities. Everything is dispersed (another argument supporting the non-local consciousness theory).

I hope you find something that makes your life more meaningful and satisfactory. I hope you find a bunch of human beings that, like you, have suffered and have enjoyed moments of their lives. A bunch of human beings that, after all, have lived.
