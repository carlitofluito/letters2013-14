The aim of this epistolary work is to know a bit better what I am now thorugh the compilation of pieces of what I have been. I have been told in the past that there was wisdom in the texts I wrote, and I am sure that there is wisdom in the texts I received. I hope you find something that makes your life more meaningful and satisfactory. I hope you find a bunch of human beings that, like you, have suffered and have enjoyed moments of their lives. A bunch of human beings that, after all, have lived. A bit of context In September 2013, I moved to Leuven (Belgium) to study my fourth and last year of Bachelor in Psychology. Many people warned me about the dangers of getting lost in the wild parties of the city, and how much a year as Erasmus student could teach me about the world. However, no one warned me about the perils I would encounter, or about how one given evening could actually change my whole life, being, and spirit… "],

To Tomás Greetings Tomás, How is everything going? I hope that well and without too many frights. I attach a letter explaining some of the thoughts I have had in my mind during these months. I mentioned my intention to call you during my stay in Barcelona but, as I explain in the letter, I preferred to use writing as a means of communication. My trip to Barcelona has left me in a rather strange state of longing, melancholy, and loss of comfort… I do not know if these beautiful three days I have spent there have been beneficial or harmful. Greetings and thanks, Carlos +++ Leuven, 10th of November of 2013. Greetings Tomás, I hope everything’s going well. Remember that the time we have is to try to live as best we can. Knowing our limits and trying not to exceed them. The first thing is to apologize. You’re going to read something that, I suppose, will cause you discomfort and disgust. It’ll probably influence you emotionally and intellectually. My ideas, let’s hope, can’t influence you, but I sense my mood will affect you. Empathy is within our human condition, as our compassion for our neighbor, which many of us forget and is left only in exceptionality. Like yours. I’m so sorry that you have to read this letter. I’m really sorry. But the situation is becoming more complicated at an unexpected and alarmingly speed. I feel pushed to ask you for help; to take on the role of psychologist and priest-confessor, (ironic considering how much you don’t like priests…). Tomás, please take your time to read and answer this letter. My problems are not in a hurry. I know your advice will always be of incredible quality, so it will be worth the wait. I also don’t want my problems to get in the way, more than they already do, and they’re going to do it, in your pace of life, in your priority issues, much more important than mine. Regarding the communicative medium, writing, I have preferred to use this letter because of the ability to reflect and reread that allows us both. In this way, we can present our organized ideas and retrieve the exact information if necessary. I don’t know if a phone conversation or a face-to-face talk would have a greater short-term impact, but the memory is very fallible. This is not, for me, a transient problem that can be solved with a coffee. It is settling into my soul, in my being, and in my mind, unconsciously and insidiously. As far as I believe, it is necessary to root it out and make future revisions so that it doesn’t regrow. Still, at Christmas (Winter Festivities) we’ll have a coffee and catch up. I will use the metaphor to help express some ideas, as my intellectual resources are markedly limited. But I would appreciate advice without and abusive use of these, unlike I have done. I would like to see clearly the way to be followed and avoid possible misinterpretations. Still, the beauty of your words and the power of the images that your metaphors can create will be a great encouragement in my disoriented search for a right path. I’d like to tell you a few things that are hanging around my head over the last few months. Probably the source of the problem, or a factor in its appearance, was the reading of a book: Pulp by Charles Bukowski. I did it as a language exercise, to improve my English, but its message has insidiously meddled in my thinking. Unconsciously. That hatred, that banality, the death, the impoverished quality of the human being of the twenty-first century, the disorder, the violence… For similar reasons, I’m no longer sure I want to read poetry anymore. The idea of death appears repeatedly and spontaneously in my thinking. It’s uncontrollable. Sometimes it blocks me, sometimes it depresses me, others it causes me frustration or anger. The multiplicity of interpretations offered by poetry, and my pre-activated mind, make me detect constant references to death. I can’t get rid of the idea. It’s lodged in my brain. This thought has led me to value the importance of life, a human being. But wrongly, I hope, I only see banality, hopelessness, a continuous wandering towards an inevitable destiny. The nonsense. This society is sinking at an alarming rate. It’s sinking unstoppably. We’re heading for the abyss. I’m losing my faith, my hope. Besides, something dangerous and new is appearing in my way of being. I’m starting to feel hate. A deep hatred towards mediocrity. A hatred that begins to take root in my heart, in my soul. It catches me in social situations, at mass parties filled with crowds without any purpose. Anesthetizing our senses, with noise, low light, and alcohol. I admit my enormous guilt since many of these thoughts of hatred manifest more intensely if I find myself under the influence of drinks. My instincts are revealed, my hate manifests. I have not had any physical fights, for I have never been a violent person, by ability and principles. I consider that intellectual capacity and aggression are inversely related. The higher the amount of one, the less of the other. Only when we feel frustrated and scarce in resources does aggression and physical violence appears. Despite the absence of physical violence, my words and thoughts portray powerful hate. My intentions are, indeed, aggressive and violent. I’m not able to start a conversation that doesn’t lead me to an argument or a clash. I start incriminating the other person, judging her, considering her mediocre, inferior, banal. Things get worse if I try to advise her, showing my point of view, instruct her, even. Who am I to teach? In those moments the confrontation is absolute. The other person gets tired and usually runs away. I still have hate-laden bullets ready to fire. Fernando doesn’t help. I think part of this mentality is generated by him, by his verses, his ideas. It’s made me hopeless. Another friend of mine, Carlos, who has a very powerful mind, has also led me down a path that I am not sure is the right one. Both Carlos and Fernando have opened my eyes, they have taught me the world of shadows in which I was living. They have pushed me out of the cave. I’ll always be indebted to them. But, I think, they’re not treating people who continue inside the cavern properly, living out of shadows. They despise them, they abandon them, they repudiate them. I want to believe that the people left in the cavern, in the banality, should be helped. But the empire of Facebook, Twitter, the Internet, and WhatsApp controls them. Their ideas are now within me. I’m afraid of this situation, it makes me nauseous and disgusted. I’m repulsed by people who are imbued, drowned. They prefer to continue to be fed with vacuous dreams, for not facing the truth. In the direction towards the exit, I hope, halfway through, I start to see the light. It blinds me. It aches and hurts me. Sometimes I wonder if it’s better to keep living in the cave, comfortably, quietly and futilely. Outside the wind intensifies, and I’m not used either to nudity, transparency, nor loneliness. I know I’m doing something wrong. I’m misinterpreting something. Or it may be that I am fighting for a lost cause, and I should embark alone on my personal goals, (An ethical force blocks me). Or should I go back to the cavern, to the blindness and join them? (Having approached the light, the truth hampers this option). I feel weak. I need support all the time. I have powerful social needs that drag me to stay inside, living out of shadows. I’m pretty lost and disoriented. I’m thinking of going to therapy to be fooled into fooling myself. Getting into the warmth of the cavern, to see the shadows and wait for death seems to me as the most feasible option. I’m loosing out on the experience of studying in a foreign country with all these thoughts in my head bombarding and bothering me. I can’t taste the beauty of diversity. I forget the power of human warmth. A few weeks ago, we had a class on the relationship between happiness and social relationships; the sadness of loneliness, of the lonely one. My nature is social, very social. I used to be happy. I’m aimless now. I think only a person as exceptional as you can give me some guidance and good advice. I need some information to make the lest incorrect decision as possible. To get out of the trap I’ve built myself. You can’t imagine, Tomás, how lucky I am to have met you. How much I admire you and the tremendous respect I have for you. Death assaults me, all the time. Thinking about your age overwhelms me with anguish. My eyes are flooding. Thinking about the unconditionality and premeditation of our destiny is very hard. I don’t know what I’m going to do when what’s going to happen actually happens, with each and every one of us. I am surprised that the oldest of my friends retains hope and believes in the future, on the change. However, youth is devastated, hopeless and lost, like me (21 years), Carlos (24) or Fernando (33). Could we pick up the towel we threw away? I’m sorry again for reading my problems and stealing your time. Eternally grateful. Carlos 2013-11-11 to 13. From Tomás Carlos, good morning. I read your letter at dawn, I have reread it afterward, and in both moments I have been worried. I had to take the dog out and clean the house, so I delayed sending you a first response. I have to write slowly, and this morning I have it a bit complicated, with some commitment that cannot be postponed. I hope to sit down this afternoon so I can send you an answer that can help you. For now, I just want you to feel that your mail has not gone to outer space and that its recipient is entangled with other things as if friends did not occupy the first step of life at the level of priorities. Leibniz, Pierre Bayle, and some other things can wait. While I sit down and order my head a little, it occurs to me to send you a couple of readings that I hope will help you to reconsider some things, especially that dark and pessimistic tone in which your letter moves. The risk of depression is always there, close to the edge of any step. It’s what it takes to be human. But depression is a disease, I’m not going to be the one to analyze it to the psychologist you are and who understand it well. You know very well where and how you are, and I am very happy that you come out of yourself and that you trust your friends, in me, although I am not sure that it will be able to be that crutch that will help you to walk. I will try, although you know very well that the way you have to walk it yourself; the others will not be more than a minor walking stick in the best of the cases. Searching in my memory for things that I have read and that can serve you, I have thought about authors like Bertrand Russell, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, and who has been one of the most important mathematicians and philosophers of the 20th century. He wrote with a wonderful English. There I send you a Spanish version and the original in English of his Conquest of happiness, in case you want to practice English, with the literature and the thought of someone who had a very complicated life, more difficult than it seems at first sight, but that always maintained the control of himself and the pulse of life. The second reading is by Erich Fromm, The Revolution of Hope, whose original English I do not have and not found on the Internet, to download for free. Anyway, I hope that the Spanish copy will be useful. I hope these readings serve you, which I imagine will counterbalance Bukowski’s stark realism. Writers write how they live, although some say they are transfigured. Bukowski is a clear example of how a writer manifests in his literature as he lives, and the life of this person was not exactly an interesting life or deserving of imitation, although it has contributed to literature a work that deserves to be analyzed. But not all readings are the most appropriate at any time. The same thing happens with music: there is music for every instant or, better, for every moment, situation or state of mind. I would balance a depressive mood with Mozart or Haydn, for example. In any case, depending on how you see yourself, you may have to seek help and put a lot of effort on your part to get out of depression. Well, let’s see if this afternoon I can sit with time ahead and I can answer you from the rationality and with the heart in the hand. When I tried to attach Russell’s file in English, I saw that it is very large, so I can not send it to you in this same email, which has a sending limitation of ten megabytes; therefore, I send it to you in another email. A hug. Tomás +++ Tomás, Thank you very much for your very quick response and your concern for me. I go to the library to read Russell (I have an e-book, but it is for occasions when the paper is scarce). I think that is exactly what I was looking for. I hope it does not take more than a couple of days to read it. I’ll tell you if it’s making a mark on my character. The road is walked alone. And you sent me a pair of good shoes to start walking. If you have priorities, accomplish them. I’ll be busy with Russell and Fromm. Health and thanks. Carlos +++ Carlos, good morning. We have a sunny morning around here; I hope you can also enjoy a sunny day and, above all, I hope and wish that today you are better than three days ago when I received your letter. I send you in Word format the answer to your letter. I do not know if I have elaborate on it too much, I simply hope that my meditations can serve you, although I know that in those, as in yours, I address many questions. With that purpose, I have written it. It has taken me longer than I would have liked and what I envisioned three days ago, but I have not been able to finish it before. I hope to see you soon, to be able to drink coffee together - you know, I will take a small juice… Oh! I should not say it, but you know that you have me at your complete disposal. A hug. +++ Valladolid, 11 November 2013 Carlos, good afternoon. I have carefully read your letter, which is very intense and sincere. It has no waste because in it you perform an exercise of sincerity, which only fits when you address the person with which you have full confidence and when the inner voice not only does not stifle but remains and even increases. This exercise of communicating our problems allows us to look into a mirror and we can analyze them and do it with ourselves with some objectivity. Moreover, this exercise, which manifests the need to face problems head-on, indicates decision and intelligence, qualities that you have always had. You can be sure that, even if you do not ask me in your letter, I will keep absolute confidentiality regarding the content of it. It’s not easy to get started, because you approach your personal circumstance in your letter in a complex way, and the answer can’t be easy. Everything we do has significance and reading has a lot of it. No reading is inconsequential to the reader; there’s always something that, like fine rain, soak through. The readings, moreover, do not wet the skin but are directed to our sensitivity and understanding. Surely, the psychological procedure becomes in that order and is first directed to our emotional, and not rational, the sensibility, to face our understanding later. But the traces of situations, approaches, ideas, language, and even the style that appear in books somehow permeate our sensitivity. There are books - novels, essays, poems - for all tastes and situations, but not all are suitable at any time in our lives. There is always something to which, consciously or unconsciously, we are inclined to read one thing and not another. When reading for pure pleasure and not for an academic obligation, for example, we must choose readings according to the inclinations or needs we have at each moment. All the works are interesting, but this does not force us to suffer from their reading; there must always be enjoyment in it, and something else, we must seek to read while keeping intact the ability to distance ourselves from the content of what we read. It is the only way for us to soak in reading, but for us and not the author to do it through our sensibility. In addition, it is the way for us to make the most of what we read. That estrangement, that kind of necessary epojé makes us smarter (from Latin intus legere, read the content inside it, penetrate its interiority), that is, it allows us to reveal how much is structural and hidden in what we read. I know it’s very easy to get involved in the content of reading, especially when we have a great story in our hands. But the story is great because it serves as a vehicle for complex and deep content; these are what’s interesting about the novel or the poems. I think we suffer from a certain educational or formative deformation, derived from the way literature has been taught and the trap that involves authors moving ideas and attitudes through stories. This is an art, but the reader must know how to allocate each thing in its own place. The little I have read from Bukowski has led me to think that his style many times, though not always, brutal and grim conveys ideas of contempt and violence, a conception of reality devoid of humanity, as if reality, people and things, were there to beat them. Acknowledging that Bukowski was a victim of himself, I can understand that the content of his works is the living or clear expression of his own personal situation. This doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be read. I myself have approached at some point his poetry and, although it is not the style and content that I like the most, it can be read, as long as it is done as I was saying, with distance, with a good mind awake so as not to fall into the claws of so many affirmations – denial is a form or modality of affirmation- as conclusive and the repetition of ideas such as that of death or others such as prostitution or the reification of human life. Gil de Biedma, like other poets and writers, wrote almost always under the influence of alcohol and it is perceived in his poetry that in his pen there is something that moves it and that is beyond soberness. Books that are read must behave like friends. I know that a book lacks a life of its own, that it does not have a heart or a sensibility that speaks directly to us, but that it is the readers who perceive its heart and its sensitivity, which is not always the same for all. It is not the book that looks us in the eye or caresses us, it is us who project on it and from it its content on ourselves; it is us who feel and interpret its content, often far removed from the intentions of the author himself. Hence I infer that books and authors, like individuals, should be the subject of choice on the part of the reader, who has in his hand the final decision. I don’t think Kafka is an author to read in times of psychological weakness; however, he is a fundamental writer, who must be read under the appropriate psychological conditions of the reader and, as I said in the previous paragraph, with the necessary distance to fit into the soul of his work. A work like Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Spirit cannot be read without a solid formation on philosophy because that work will behave upon the reader as an enemy if we lack it; it will be like an immensely tall and abrupt mountain range, impossible to encompass. Books and authors have their time, so their choice is critical. It is difficult to know in advance whether what we have chosen is the right thing, if it will bring us something positive, like friends, but we will know it right away, the moment we come into contact with the work. Therefore, with books we have to act like with people, we must discriminate them according to the friendliness they awaken in us. If Bukowski is not a good company at a time, his reading is discarded, and absolutely nothing happens. There are moments to read Ovid’s Tristia ex Ponto and others to read the Epigrams of Marco Valero Marcial. Reading should serve to lift our spirits, not to be angry, oppressed, or depressed. Depression is a terrible disease. I’m not going to show you anything, but it’s you who could speak out broadly and with a sense of this disease. But it is a disease that places us on the edge of nothingness, nullifies us and enslaves us in the dark, preventing us from being ourselves, even though, when we go through depression, we think that we are authentically ourselves. It is us in our full selfhood when we are in full mastery of ourselves, when our qualities or abilities (I do not like the term competences) shine, are in full force, and during a depression, these are darkened, as covered by a great veil that suffocates them. It is a state from which one does not always come out by oneself, but with help, although one does not come out of it without putting effort, tenacity, and willpower. I don’t know how you feel; nobody knows it better than you and no one better than you to determine if you need help or if you have enough strength to get out of that state on your own. The permanent idea of death is worrying. I confess that I have written many poems about death, but it does not affect me to write about it or read verses or texts that speak of it. It is there and appears when nature wants, but I am very clear that speaking in human terms, death is the failure of life, especially when it does not arrive naturally. On Friday, they pay tribute to my lifelong friend, to a person with whom I have lived around the clock from the age of twelve to twenty-five and with whom I have shared even money. I have enjoyed his successes and have often been a shoulder to cry on for him - and he for me, of course. He died of a fulminant cancer last July 25. He was Professor of Public International Law and International Relations at the University of Zaragoza. Above all, he was my friend and a person committed to democracy and human rights since his (our) youth. Society has lost a great mind and above all a great person. I have mourned him more than anyone in this life and I do not forgive the nature who has taken him, but I have to accept his definitive absence. As you can understand, I’ll be in that homage, and I’ve had to accept reality. I only understand death as a moment of life, produced by nature itself. The rest, as the Stoics tell about death, has always seemed to me to be a failure not only of life itself but of the person. Adverse situations should be dealt with effort and help, if necessary. That’s what friends and, if they’re required, professionals are for. The loss of a loved one stirs our guts and makes us rethink the meaning of life. It does not occur to me that reading something, however intense, will affect us so much that we enter a personal crisis. It can make us think again, meditate so that we can specify our conception of life or things, but one must always be above what is read. Autonomy and self-control are fundamental conditions of freedom. You know that the highest suicide rate is that of the Nordic countries, geographical areas where the climate is very adverse, with hardly any solar radiation. You may also be falling victim, not only of the environment and readings but of Belgium’s own climate, which has very little to do with Valladolid’s, at least in terms of solar radiation. Alcohol and drugs alienate us, deprive us of our own abilities, weakening our autonomy and self-control. I do not understand the environments of binge drinking, which are environments created and supported by interests foreign to the people. No one frees himself from problems by alienating himself, but on the contrary, he enslaves oneself to something as alien as an addictive substance that ends up being our owner. There are too many economic and ideological interests behind the culture of drugs and, in particular, alcohol and, why not, rock culture and its derivatives, which are associated with it, but this is not the time to analyze this, an analysis, which, as it cannot be otherwise, the rockers do not share. I confess that I have never been able to drink more than two wines, that I have never come close to drunkenness, precisely because, like everyone else, I have seen drunk people since I was a child and I have always rejected that state. The first drunk I met was a gentleman who got into our class, at school, when I was a kid when I was five or six. The teacher, a great teacher, by the way, treated him gently and got him out; but that show shocked me so much that I have never been able to understand or comprehend the culture of alcohol or drugs. I think I understood what that meant. Moreover, university students and young people, in general, do not conceive of the week without alcohol only indicates the lack of personal maturity of those who practice it. We do not need to be high to socialize, but rather authentic human relationships are born and grown from authenticity, whose foundations are in sincerity, loyalty, commitment and, among other things, self-control and autonomy. The rest, the nonsense that Tierno Galván could say in his day and others now about fun and its relationship with alcohol, only lead to the self-destruction and destruction of society. I will seem radical to you, but the social, cultural, political, personal… consequences of drug culture are devastating in all aspects, and alcohol is a hugely potent and destructive drug. Poetry is but a literary genre, although some discuss it. Whether you look at it, it is offered and used as an instrument of expression that can reach artistic heights. It is not only form and beauty, as some - to some extent Fernando - argue. When we use the word, we express content, with greater or lesser fortune and, if there is no content, there is no literature, there is nothing that can be valuable. Any poem impacts our sensitivity even before our understanding. Besides, we usually stop reading that poem whose reading doesn’t move us. Poetry is, therefore, a very powerful weapon, like everything that directs towards our sensitivity, like advertising, for example. Next to and below the emotion and the feeling of beauty that provokes any poem translates ideas, those that impact us and, as I said before regarding readings, must be sifted by our own reflection. In any case, poetry should be read like any other literary genre, with a certain distance from the read content. This does not mean that we read impassively, but strategically that procedural estrangement allows us to understand, to know better, to feel more intensely when we read, but with the difference that we keep intact our ability to analysis, our autonomy over the other. And I think this very thing has to be done in ordinary life. We’re not going to a class to get emotional, but to focus our attention on the content of the teacher’s speech. The act of focusing attention means nothing more than to concentrate our capabilities - in its entirety - to be able to understand how much we hear and, to do so, we constantly discriminate against the content and distinguish the fundamentals of the incidental and capture the relationships between the different content that we consider as valuable. If we were emotionally involved in the content of the teacher’s speech, we would very hardly understand the content of it and surely never get to pass the subject and finish the studies. The poet Bukowski, like Fernando or any other poet, must be read to enjoy and never to suffer. The Bukowski of Hug the Darkness, of Bluebird, or of True, for example, must be read from a distance. In any case, if a poem or a poet does not excite us and that emotion is not accompanied by positive contributions - ethical, aesthetic, ideological, etc. – its reading is cut off and we pass on to something else. Maybe at another moment, we’ll find out in it what we don’t see now. But if this is not the moment, we must not insist. With reading we have to enjoy, never suffer or endure. There are poets whose readings always seem new. The classics, the immortals. To give some examples of Spanish literature: Lorca, Machado, Miguel Hernández, Gamoneda, Gonzalo Rojas or Juan Gelman. Even though they are classic, our spirit - if it is worth the word - not always tastes its texts. They are there, they are offered to us and we are the ones who choose and taste them. They are a delicacy, but it is the diner who enjoys them. It is very typical of confusing personal moments and times of social crisis when one is tempted to see on the horizon and on his back a destiny that leads us to an irremediable horizon and end. Those of us who were born in the middle of dictatorship and saw the dictator live and rule so calmly, who perceived that Spanish society was suppressed and, worse, was submissive to the dictator’s own empire were tempted to think that our own destiny was written, that there was no other opportunity than surviving as it were, because we could do nothing to straighten that twisted tusk of the dictatorship and the fate of Spain and, with it, ours and that of each of us. However, many were involved in the struggle for democracy, such as my friend Angel, whom I have quoted you before. Passivity leaves all possible means in the hands of the power and we are left with the citizens who are defenseless and subdued. It is true that in our society mediocrity abounds even in the positions of greatest responsibility, but this is what we have so far. The horizon is clear, and mediocrity, indifference, inaction, and even violence are gradually overcome, unfortunately never completely, but our obligation as individuals and citizens is to give our best. It is the sowing that we can and must do, it is the power that we hold in our hands and it is also our own responsibility. Turning a blind eye and taking refuge in supposedly saving selfishness leads to inaction and immobility. By this path, there would never have been a Thales of Miletus or a Ramon y Cajal, a Darwinist theory of evolution or the knowledge about the genetic code. There is the example of inaction in the field of knowledge that occurred during the Middle Ages. Involving oneself implies commitment and generosity, but without them, together with other values, such as the impulse for the search for truth, the love of justice, the respect or the dialogue, for example, nothing improves, neither society, nor companies, nor States, nor human beings. Mass parties and great mass events anesthetize; the media anesthetize with their TV shows about frivolities; the monopoly of football, so many vacuous contests, so much banal literature, etc., etc. It’s easy to complain and stay in the lament, selling the image of lament as if something was built with it. We must analyze, but the analysis, which never implies complaint or regret alone, should lead to action: to educate ourselves as best and as much as possible, to work, to research, to publish, in a nutshell, to offer society the best of ourselves; it is the way to find ourselves and create spaces of personal fulfillment that bring us happiness. We may feel rejection or aversion to injustice or lack of freedoms, for example. The rejection of something implies a choice, positioning in the face of reality and taking a stance before it, which is already an active attitude. Hate destroys coexistence, paralyzes us and places us in the anteroom of violence, with which only destroys and never builds something worthwhile. There’s one aspect that has really worried me not only in your letter but in my own life. I mean the role of the intellectual and, before all, that of the citizen. Although to some extent I have already answered, I would like to add a brief reflection on this particular issue. The problem is whether the intellectual can and should even settle for doing his work in a professional manner or whether to demand from both the intellectual and any citizen something else, a greater commitment to society. The image of Plato’s cavern you quote in your letter is very clairvoyant. The wisest is not the one who leaves the cavern, since he always comes out with the help of other people, the pedagogue, in the case of platonic myth; the wisest, the one who, in Aristotle’s words, leads a virtuous life, is the one who, in addition to leaving the cavern and walking the way to the contemplation of the sun, the truth, that is, performs the ascending dialectical process, returns to the cavern in order to help other prisoners out of it -descending dialectics-. There Plato – and the common sense – tells us clearly what the role of the intellectual, the philosopher, and, by extension, the true citizen is. The posture of those who believe that they have left the cavern and stand there, still, satisfied outside of the cavern forgetting its origins, enjoying and reserving for themselves the sweetness of knowledge and art, only deserves reproaches. They are a clear manifestation of the social and personal selfishness that has always occurred and that populates our time. They are antisocial beings because they only want for themselves what belongs to everyone, regardless of their social origin. Here is the foundation of the validity of universal education, of public education, which guarantees access to training to all without distinction. Returning to the cavern is an act of responsibility, a due act, forced from the point of view of moral conscience. Staying out means living in overt irresponsibility. If I am honest with you, here is the rational and moral unifying thread that directed me to teach, instead of focusing on engineering, as my teachers wanted. Do not take me as a hero, because I am not, I do not intend to present myself as an example of anything; after all, I’ve done what I wanted and I liked, nonetheless, having to overcome very difficult obstacles, but I haven’t been the only one in this either. Doing what you like and want contributes to your happiness and thus benefits and enriches society. In short, we would all like to do in life what we like, and I think we should aspire to achieve it. Returning to Plato and those who do not have solidarity and social commitment in their minds, it can be said that they renounce a part or aspect of life that contributes to their own happiness and deprive society of a good that belongs to it. Following the course of your letter, you end up with a self-incrimination meditation. I don’t know if you have to accuse yourself of things. It is one thing to analyze, to stop in the way, to look in the mirror and to draw conclusions that lead to decisions that seem appropriate, another to blame for defects or faults and, worse, that this prosecution process paralyzes us and leads us to a sick situation or even sickness. The first thing must be done from time to time, as any aircraft or boat pilot does, which corrects the course at short intervals, after having done the necessary checks and calculations; self-incrimination is something else, especially when it is easy that certain circumstances outside oneself have been determinants of the personal situation: friends who do not help, personal loneliness, remoteness of family and loved ones, the weather, new companions, language, et cetera. As it happens to all of us, you may be doing something wrong, but this is no reason to fall into a depression, let alone for self-destructive thoughts or feelings to appear. You’re finishing the degree you chose in your day because it was the one you liked, you’ve done your studies brilliantly, you have a supportive family and loyal friends to trust. You have the circumstances in your favor. I think you have a favorable career and personal circumstances for you to finish your studies in Belgium as you have done so far, taking advantage of the opportunity to study abroad, which is still a real opportunity to acquire a more open academic and personal education with broad horizons. It is you who know better than anyone the trap you have built or fallen into. Surely it consists in the aim of encompassing too many areas, widening the circle of interests and obligations beyond the degree you are studying. It is good - and necessary - that you focus on the contents of the degree you are finishing. Psychology is an area of complex knowledge with a future, which deserves full dedication. The fact that you relate and befriend people who quite surpass you in age may have led you to try to live up to their dedication to other areas of knowledge. We would all like to know everything and, moreover, to the maximum degree, but this is not possible. To grow as a person and be a good professional, we have to narrow the area of interests and especially the area to which we are dedicated. As if we were proceeding in circles, the greatest dedication must be in what we have chosen as the scope of priority knowledge; from there, other concentric circles that refer to areas of knowledge compatible with the first and complementary to each other; but key dedication must focus on the priority. The trajectory or the fruits of others’ activity should not be magnified. We tend to think that what those close to us, who are moving away from our area of dedication, do is so interesting that we see ourselves in the need to emulate them. Maybe that’s where we set ourselves a trap. What others do, painters, musicians, poets or scientists, whatever the branch of science, may be wonderful, but we must understand that this area of knowledge is what they chose in their day and that, precisely because they made it their priority dedication, they excel in it and make contributions to society. But how many of them do not look at others with eyes of admiration; if they were sincere, they would all reveal to us how much they admire people with dedications to an area of knowledge far removed from their own. The limitation of our time and capabilities, coupled with the increasing complexity of knowledge, means that we have to be realistic and delimit the area of knowledge in which we want to be competent and, if possible, with the maximum degree of excellence. It is from there that we gradually build the elements necessary to be happy and contribute as much as possible to the well-being of society. The rest, that we age, for example, is part of the inevitable vital process, and in which we should not think, because it is useless or worthless. There is a thought that I have had clear since I was a child, that the future is built by us. Time, following Kant, does not exist outside of ourselves, but rather is a universally necessary condition that we impose on people, the subject, on things. In this sense, although we find it strange, we own our time, which makes us owners and responsible for our lives. We are what we leave and that heritage that we leave we build it little by little, from the moment we have personal autonomy until our body ceases to have a chance of survival. Knowledge and affections, how much we build throughout life mean that sowing that we leave there as a constituent part of our own being; it is what we leave, spread among others, and that identifies us or allows us to remain beyond the limitation of the duration of our lives. This permanence does not have to always be publicly recognized, that is, by society as a whole; we stay, we remain in feelings and therefore in the memory of the nearest and sometimes even our identity is recognized beyond that limit. It doesn’t matter the apparent extent of our heritage. There we left as much as we could or was in our power to leave as an inheritance. This improves life and society. The tensions to which we subject ourselves, increased by the pressures and uncertainty created by society in general and the unique moment in which we live – which, on the other hand, will always be unique – place us in scenarios that are not always easy and, often difficult. Although it may seem like a utopia, good therapy is to try not to enter into the competitive game or trap that the propaganda sets us. More than just being competitive, we must be as competent as possible in that area of knowledge where we have specialized; competitiveness, that is, the place we occupy in society must be the result of our own competence, the degree of knowledge that we have reached and of what we are able to offer ourselves and others. Entering the game of competitiveness as a goal and strategy leads to stress, anguish and, ultimately, depression and, with all, to be less ourselves and even to be set apart. A conception of life as a struggle or war may seem very beautiful, as Heráclito and all economic liberalism said, but this conception is only useful to those who hold power and have it, that is, it is – or believes it is - safe from the swings of the all-out war of competitiveness. When those in power fall, they ask for help and demand the solidarity of others. It is a war that lowers us to the level of the animal that we are, of the mammal we are, that has to mark the territory and fight to conquer and maintain it. This new conception of reality – which, on the other hand, is not so new and which is, for example, in the Gospel – must be elaborated and worked, not fight, but worked to sow and flourish. A life focused on personal fulfillment, complementarity, sociability, empathy, respect, sense of duty, etc., that leads people to achieve the highest possible degree of happiness. I think I’ve elaborated on a lot and I’m not sure I’ve written anything that you may find valuable or, at the very least, useful. I, therefore, offer you my reflections made in the thread of some of your reflections, which have seemed to me significant, among those you address or suggest in your letter. I know I’ve been on my toes about the problems you’re raising, but I don’t know if this is the right time to take each of them one by one and extend myself thoroughly. I am satisfied if my meditations help you return to yourself and, now, calmly, slowly and looking for objectivity, you will reorient your state or situation. A hug. Tomás. (Valladolid, 13 November 2013) 2013-11-14. To Tomás Thank you very much Tomás, I attach my answer. It provokes a very hopeful sensation the fact of communicating by letter more than by e-mail in the 21st century. Greetings. +++ Leuven, 14th of November of 2013 Greetings Tomás, Thank you very much for your very complete response. I have been extremely satisfied with its reading and I will read it again as soon as I have time. Your sincere and felt writing is also appreciable. I value filled with gratitude the exercise of empathy and esteem you have performed. Tomás, my letter is not as worked as your answer, because I write it almost in one go and without too much revision. The last paragraphs of your letter deserve a mandatory rereading, and subsequent reflection and answer. Just to mention, although I probably haven’t fully understood them, I’ve been moved. Emotion always ahead. Your tips are affecting me in a pretty fast and powerful way. It may be that being able to express myself, organize my thinking and look for and find a reason for my situation, are helping me to modify it. The sensation of feeling understood and heard that you transmit to me is undoubtedly a powerful effect on my mood. I think the music I’ve been listening to, almost uninterruptedly, since I read your first message (Mozart’s symphonies), is playing a pretty crucial role. His music is elegant and subtle, jovial and full of life. It penetrates more gently and respectfully within me than Bukowski’s literature did, and its impact is, for the moment, quite powerful. I’m letting myself get soaked. I avoid the Requiem and Lacrimosa. There are moments and moments. Even without any technical knowledge in music, I can notice the impact of grim songs on my emotional state. Concerning getting soaked, fine rains and solar radiation. I have long compared the temperature in Leuven and Valladolid. They seem to be weather-connected, as it is surprising the climatic similarity between these two cities. My source of information is the weather predictor, so I can’t trust too much either. Here, I suppose, it rains a lot more. Therefore, the sky is usually greyer. But after it rains like after crying faces like the sunny skies unwrap Del Val, F. Ice Tongues (There are moments and moments, poems and poems) And if it rains intensely the sky usually gives us a bright afternoon, (when there was afternoon, now the sun dies at 18.00). I quote the previous poem, also concerning your reflection on poetry, conscious understanding and the affectation of this on emotion. I don’t think I’ve come to understand all the symbology or the full meaning of Fernando’s poem, but of all the ones I’ve read, this is one of those who stuck to my memory. He likes to appear from time to time, in situations where, after suffering, I see more clearly both present and past facts. I may be starting to see the light after this period of continuous fine rain, with heavy intermittent showers. I’ve started reading Russell. It was a brilliant recommendation. I read it as long as time permits. I’m in the second chapter and it’s amazing how well his arguments fit into my concerns. It seems that he would have written it tailor-made for me, for the contemporary man. Knowing you’re not the only one helps, too. I know the relationship you had with your friend. I don’t think I’m going to imagine the suffering you’ve had to go through, the one you’re going through right now, and the one you’re going to go through in the future. These kinds of ideas and thoughts go deep, but in moments of emotional weakness they attack us and try to sink us. As the older person that you are, and given the different situations in which you have lived, you know death better than I do: its presence in various contexts, or in people you appreciated to a different extent. The little I can know about death has been taught to me by poetry, mainly that of Fernando, as in the poem the slowness and the absolute, or in: lie the ashes when they settle on the rooftops lies the death lie the lies all is finishment we’re made of premeditated unreality Del Val, F. Orpheus in New York. A couple of years ago, I also received a very hard and heavy lesson. The death of my cousin Monica, at her 22 years old, while in France, performing her end-of-career internship as a chemical engineer at a European company. An immaculate, beautiful, incredibly sweet, intelligent, hard-working, dedicated, cheerful person. The death that, at the wrong time, snatches huge, very precious people. The failure of life. These are lessons that we will not forget, Tomás. They will accompany us for as long as we are in this world. Now, my uncles are the ones who are really suffering from it. They do have depressions and anxiety attacks. My thing is passing sadness. As for Fernando, I see that you have not wanted to underline what we have already said on other occasions about his ideas and thoughts. Although I detect throughout the letter a powerful argument to tear down his ideas, or at least to face them. I like to believe that Fernando still has a lucid and clear spirit, that is why I like to quote his poems. Besides, I like the rocker’s ideal about poetry: literary genre, and something else. But there are moments and moments. I’m going to stop reading poetry for a while. At least until the exams are over, which will be in February, more or less. With Russell, Fromm and the syllabus readings, I’ll have quite a believe. I link this idea with the one you raise about resources, the need for specialization and focus in a field of knowledge. As the wise and intelligent person you are, you’ve detected something that, even myself, had overlooked. Indeed, I usually relate to people older than me, and as Festinger defends in the Theory of Social Comparison, human beings seek information in their environment to know themselves. I wanted to compare myself to people who, in addition to being exceptional in their field and outside of it, like you, Carlos or Fernando, are older than me. You have had more time to work on your specialties and poke around other corners of knowledge. It’s my learning greed that guides me to these relationships, but I can’t let the comparison bore through my self-esteem comparison. Here in Leuven, I like to visit exhibitions and have coffees with a girl who, for a few weeks, is 30 years old. It is surprising how much knowledge he has. But even she reminds me (and her) that many differences in our ways of thinking, and the content of our ideas are determined by the age of each of us and the books that we have found time to read. Reading your letter has renewed my strength. I add here, that when quality is as remarkable as it is in your reflections, it’s never too much. It drew a smile on my face when I saw that with a three-sheets letter you had answered an eight-pages one. Your answer has helped me remember what I had decided in the past, but sadness had clouded and prevented recovering it from my memory. I like social networks. I would like to achieve the master’s degree, to which we have previously referred, in this field. Physical social networks, the tool through which, among many other things, ideas and attitudes are disseminated. I used to be a dreamy teenager who wanted to change the world. Social networks knowledge is a powerful tool to be a little closer to my utopian goal. But I’m a little afraid of knowledge. Tools can be used for different purposes, many of them outside of ethics and morals. To what extent, knowing how an idea spreads and manages to change the view of the majority is a too powerful weapon for the times of moral laxity in which we live? This is a question that I beg you to help me answer it. I read Skinner’s Beyond Freedom and Dignity, which raised some of these dilemmas. I read two summers ago, and in English, thus without the right tools. Then, I can’t get much back from that reading. But I remember an argument in the book: the tool is free of morals. The knife is created as a tool, morale lies in the person who uses it. I also remember one counter-argument by you and another teacher: there are immoral tools. Atomic bombs, or torture tools, were designed to destroy and damage. I don’t know what to think about social media, a tool with countless applications, for good and for evil. I also have the strength now to defend my arguments and ideas. It used to be more influential, and quickly yielded to the arguments of others. Fernando undermined my hopes, soaking me up with his ideas during the last conversations we had. On many occasions, I abide by them without excessive critical thinking. Now, I want to build and defend patterns and guides that can lead me towards my goals. The rigid is weak, and the flexible, resistant. But I want to have a solid structure, despite the flexibility and modifiability that I may possess. I really liked your reflection on the whining spirit of many modern intellectuals. I think that you defend a very complete idea, oriented towards analysis, shaping, and understanding of the situation, rather than an empty complaint whose effects will not lead to the solution of the problem. Another attitude I’d forgotten: look for whys, know the factors, and try to modify them if they should be modified. You helped me remember the optimistic person I used to be. I also thank writing for this result. As you have well suggested, writing is a mirror in which, some days we can look old and tired, and others rejuvenated and splendid. The morals shared by Plato, Aristotle, and I suppose many other great thinkers are extremely interesting and gainable. I have spoken to Carlos, a great admirer of Chopin, Lao-Tse or Kandinsky, among others. After explaining him your reflection on the moral obligation to help the people inside the cavern, which he took as a personal attack (even having indicated that it was not!); he admitted to be socially selfish. I raised the act of generosity that Kandinsky, Chopin, and Lao-Tse, among so many others, had performed and for which now he can enjoy them. I will develop these ideas in our future conversations, which I will suggest to be made through letters, such as yours and mine because it allows a clearer and more thorough presentation of the arguments. Finally, simply thank you. You already know the admiration and respect I feel for you, which are increasing every time we know each other better. I will try to maintain an objective view of the situation and avoid social comparison. I know your age, older than mine, and your almost limitless abilities. I do not want to compare the knowledge that a person as exceptional as you possess, with those that a 21-year-old average person, as I am, can have. I also don’t want to think if when I become your age, I’ll even reach half your faculties. Thank you very much for your support and help, and as you have already noticed in the style and content of my letter, my mood is improving. I wanted to change, and the individual will with a significant dose of social assistance is getting me there. A warm hug. Carlos 2014-01-19 To Tomás Hello Tomás, I know this is going to look like a draft, I’m sorry. It is what it is. I’m writing to you in a hurry. It’s the exam period. So forgive me for the stumbling of words, ideas and forms. I just want to tell you that this is the first letter of many more that will come in the future. I discovered the puzzle piece that didn’t fit. The computer, the Internet. I was completely trapped by technology. I had to give all my tech gadgets to a roommate so I could study at ease and calmly. I promise you it’s been one of the most liberating experiences of my life. I am extremely comfortable and very focused, and I notice that I take much more advantage of the time. I’ll explain the more detailed experience in the future. These days have been very fruitful. I have a lot of projects and ideas that I’m jotting down as they appear in my mind. At the same time, I am moving forward with my studies at an incredible speed and with incredible efficiency. I read an article about positive emotions that deserves a letter apart (Fredrickson, 2001). I’m much better. Now I have to ask for your help, Tomás. I want to share this experience with the world and influence them so that people can experience this technological liberation. To be able to produce and create. I know there are a lot of people with the same problem as me, but some of them know it and some don’t. But we’re stuck in this tech network. A lot of untapped potentials. I write to you with tears of passion, pain, and joy. Tomás, I have a plan, an idea, a project. I can, we can make this change. But I need you to confirm that I can count on your support. I need your enormous knowledge so that the project grows and people can develop and grow on their own. I have named the project “Do you really need it? Plug off. Handwriting.” (Later, it came to my mind, “Does it really matter?”) “Do you really need it? Does it really matter? Disconnected. Write by hand.” I don’t know if Plug off is correct or not, I didn’t check it because I was disconnected. I’m not going to do it now, that I have internet access and I could, because I have to study for exams. More than 4 days writing Plug off in numerous sheets and I do not know if it is right or wrong. Best of all, I don’t care. The idea grows and its content and details are a matter of science, which will be solved later. Tomás, I will work and sort ideas, exposing them with calm, order and coherence. I have some doubts in some respects that I will expose you. But for now, I’d just like to know if I can count on you. I hope you’re doing all right. I’d like to hear from you. But until the 29th I can’t give you the time you deserve. I am sorry. From 1 to 10, I will be in Morocco, so the letters and the project will be delayed a few days. A huge, excited hug, Carlos Fredrickson, B. L. (2001).

Letter to the deaths. - Self-deception 2014-02-11 From Paloma 2014-02-11 To Paloma 2014-02-17 To Tomás", " The re-connection (January - March) 2014-02. Letter to the deaths. - Self-deception Hello Tom (1991 - 2007) Hello Monica (1989 - 2011) I’m writing to you in a selfish way. Because I need you. I need to write to someone. I need to tell someone what I’m learning . I’m self- deceiving myself, thinking that I’m not taking time out from you, because for you there is nothing left. You have plenty of time now that you’re not here. I’m deceiving myself because I need you. I need to write to you. I think I’m giving you something, and even dead, I’m taking away from you. I hope you are in peace, and I’m not bothering you with this letter. I need people, I need the lies. Still. I just realise that I am not going to be able to study the Social Networks Master’s Degree next year, since I missed the deadline. It seems even funny to know that I was already dead. I had been dead for a month and I didn’t know it. That I had one of the happiest weeks of my life and my future was dead. That I was living the present, happy. Filled with wellbeing . Helping the world. All of this thanks to my past, thanks to forgetting my past, to emptying my heart, filling my stomach, weakening my ambitions and strengthening my bones. I was happy, infinitely happy. Blooming, productive. In less than a week I went from consuming cannabis to considering seriously not killing animals for my own benefit or consumption. I abandoned my self, my egoism. I have emptied myself, my morality is now focused on the other. I couldn’t steal if its other’s belongings, I couldn’t steal knowing that somebody needs more than me. I couldn’t breathe if my oxygen would cause someone else’s death. I’ve given in, I’ve emptied myself. But I fill myself. I fill myself often. Ambitions. I need this letter for working for the world, for them, for those alive. For every person that is still here. I needed to talk to those over there to realise that I have to work for this world. I must share this happiness and wellbeing that I have achieved. To spread and to give. Life is giving, therefore I’m begging to the Death. So that the Death gives to life what it takes from it. From a cemetery,I’m writing. From a cemetery, I learn. Because the living, with thedead, are still connected. That is why I want to study Social Networks becausekeeping my happiness is selfish because watching suffering calmly is selfish,being willing to change is ambition, but enjoying other’s suffering is egotistic. And I’m alone, and I’m not alone. Because people exist. Because I cannot change anybody. The change is within each one, and outside, through writing. Talking to the dead and taking from the Death what it takes from us every day. We want It to give our life back. But prayers are selfish, writing is sharing. I’m writing for myself and on behalf of others. Because my letters have a receiver, even if they’re dead. Because it remains written, and any alive person will read it. Because I empty myself giving, and I fill myself back by emptying other people. Because I search for calm, and I give calm. I don’t hold it. Icreate emptiness in my body, so I can host others within me. And I don’t ask for anything in return. I don’t ask for anything they aren’t willing to give. I have air, water, food, and people. I have an empty glass to be filled. 2014-02-11 From Paloma Hello Carlos, how’s it going? The missing one… I guess you’ve been traveling, haven’t you? Morocco, isn’t it?? Ui, ui, that healthy envy. Surely it has been an experience, tell me things. I’m going to Bristol this week to see some friends and see if I can disconnect a little. What’s that about you losing your phone? I hope that you solve it soon. You are such a mess!! Well, how were the exams? I suppose fucking nicely or at least well. You’re probably already handling yourself speaking English very very well, Manuel. Hahahahahaha. And what plans do you have for this quarter?? I’ve finished the exams and I did nice although I haven’t yet been given the psychosocial mark. They’re so slow. And nothing… All subjects pass and that. Although I am aiming for more. Now starting the next quarter and I think that the party is gonna be over… Many assignments and many classes to which I have to go necessarily. In fact, right now, I am in “Psychology of personality”, and it seems to me that participation and ass-kissing count more than anything else. Hahaha. I also wanted to ask you for an opinion on how to work on the subjects and all that, and which are themost interesting and so on. But well, you will tell me if you remember. I have: personality, critical thinking, health, linguistic and cognitive development, and psychological evaluation. When you can and feel like it, you tell me what you want. I relied too much on your advice that has always been good for me. Regarding my life, not so much novelty: living in Salamanca and disconnected a little bit from my life from before, honestly… I want to do new thingsssss!!!! So that’s what I tell youuu. I hope you enjoy the quarter and we talk soon, ok? Be happy!! A huge kiss, freak! 2014-02-11 To Paloma Hello Paloma, I’m all very well. I arrived yesterday from Morocco. A fantastic experience. I’m writing a chronicle of the trip, so when I finish it I will send it to you so that you give me your opinion before posting it on the blog. When you travel, open your eyes, talk to people, ask them the most basic and absurd thing you can think of. The world is full of nuances to taste. Leave your phone in airplane mode during the day. Enjoy the moment. Others can wait for a while for them to know how you’re doing. Take pictures of everything that deserves a photo. Good pictures, you know how to take them. But leave the best moments for your memory. Don’t photograph those. The stars of the Sahara sky cannot be photographed with the smartphone. The sunset on the mountainous horizon while I was meditating/praying on a dune, can’t be photographed either. I got goosebumps every time I think about it. If you really want to disconnect, don’t worry about others. Your time is yours. You can tell them you’re going to be out there and when you get back, you’ll let them know. The cell phone has appeared. It’s at Charleroi Airport. It’s 20€ transport to go back and forth. So, I will see if I can find someone who can pick it up for me. It makes me think it showed up. I think a lot about how I have behaves in the past with the goods that didn’t belong to me. I need time to think about that… My grades are given to me on the 13th of February. Everything went pretty good. I’ll tell you when I know numerically. English works in ups and downs, oscillating. Plans for the quarter: too many. But at least I’m getting used to not using the computer/smartphone, writing by hand and sleeping less than six hours. We will see what are the results… Don’t use your smartphone/computer when you’re in class. Look at the professor’s face. They will have already explained to you how important feedback is at this point. Live in the moment. Technology is a tool, not a part of you. You don’t go with a hammer to class and you start hitting the table. Even if you can. Every tool has its moment. Control the tool so the tool won’t control you. Look with your eyes and think with your brain. Write with your hands. About the subjects of this quarter. Personality. I got a distinction with honors. It’s true it’s about “ass-kissing”. Interest, curiosity, participation are prettier words, though. Palenzuela is a pretty active, nocturnal person, like me. We got and get along pretty well. He’s not the best teacher, he gets messy with the ideas quite often. But it makes you think twice as much, so you can build on your own what he means. Take it as a challenge, not as a threat. Critical thinking. I did almost every assignment with an incredibly hard-working girl. She did most of them. Read the book and take it as a guide. It’s all there. Silvia was my teacher. Very friendly, nice and accessible. We got along very well. Health. Góngora also gets messy by himself. Sometimes he explains things in one practice group that he doesn’t explain in another. Compare your notes with people from other groups and take lots of notes in the theoretical class. He knows a lot. If you’re interested, ask questions. However, well, it’s clinical psychology, and it wasn’t my favorite subject. Evaluation. If Cristina Genaro is your teacher, go to class and copy everything she says. Looks like a dictation. It’s kind of ridiculous for a university class, but it’s what he asks on the exam. Go to the practice class. If it Genaro is not your teacher, I have no idea. Cognitive development. Read the articles before you go to class. Go to the library one afternoon, no phone or computer. Take a couple of hours to read it. You’re going to make the most of the class and save time in May. The work is long and tiresome. Try to anticipate and get it done with time. It’s pretty methodical, so you don’t have to think too much, but you have to work a lot. It takes time. Live the present, Paloma. Quit technology and meet people. You don’t tell everyone everything you do. Write something for yourself. Handwrite. Do things one at a time. Focus on what you’re doing and forget problems you can’t fix right now. Note them up so you won’t forget about them and you’ll fix them in the future. Learn and let yourself be influenced. Don’t prejudge, as much as it is possible. You’re smart enough to make your decisions on your own. But if you need help, ask for it. Always. We’re in touch, Paloma. I also attach to you the work I did in Personality. It’s two pages. Palenzuela quite liked it, so you can trust it to be fine. But he’ll remember, so don’t copy it. I hope it will guide you. Don’t get stuck with the writing question. Read it slowly, and if you don’t understand something it’s normal. You haven’t studied it yet. I think the terms “personality process” and “personality in action” are reversed. That’s what he corrected when I gave it to him. Personality in action is the operation of the personality in process and the personality state is the result of the personality process. Don’t trust me too much, wait for May. When you read it again everything will make more sense and you can correct my work. A kiss, Carlos. 2014-02-17 To Tomás Coming soon "],

Currently, I am writing the story of A., my psycho, and I am using different texts to figure out how troubled my mind was due to her influence, which was quite a bit. Thus, today, like any other day, it is a good moment to reflect on how my life and my mind is. After all, this is not a YouTube video where I have to say something inspiring or whatever, here I can delve and deepen a bit more in myself. (I think you haven’t written to me yet, by the way. Your problem, not mine). So, I wake up about 20 minutes ago in the office. I stayed here last night because I was editing my 24 hours of social media experiment, and undoubtedly, it is better to do it with the bigger screen at the office and the laptop, than just with the laptop at home. Also, I wasn’t really sleepy because I had drunk some coffee with soy milk, but I lied down with the 25-minutes power nap and light off because my eyes and brain were tired of looking at the screen all day. However, as it happens pretty much always, 25 min ended, and then I put 35, that became 1hour 30, that blablabla, suddenly I don’t care about my life anymore and I woke up on the floor when my most diligent colleagues are already in their offices. And for the record, that is my face after waking up in the office: This is my life, as I told you in the Facebook conversation. Getting entertained with work, close to becoming an addict, and fighting my express depressions with whatever I can find. I have been recently in probably my worst period in Brussels. I was giving so many fucks that I wasn’t taking care of myself the minimum amount, not even the least. For example, Saturday, after struggling with leaving home, I finally went to a café, making myself believe that I was going to work there, but in the last minute changed my plan, got into a bus, and read about the ills of civilization (Civilized to Death by Christopher Ryan). After an hour of public transport reading, I entered the café, write a half-page about my inability to carrying on with my life, and then struggle to put my brain in order again. I have been masturbating more than ever, systematically skipping exercise, using meditation to fight back my thoughts and my loneliness, sporadically indulging in junk food and overeating sugar, spending almost full days in my bed, tapping the phone and reopening social media apps like a Pavlovian dog craving dopamine. Just because I have ADHD and this highly positive nature, it couldn’t score clinically as a major depressive episode. I see a friendly colleague, and my social needs are supplied for the day. I exercise 15 minutes in the morning, and I felt that the morning was a success. I am able to write some pages about my story with A., and I have a feeling of accomplishment. Really, my standards have been lowered to unsuspected levels. I am in such deep shit, that taking one hand out of it and feeling the air on my palm feels as if I were clean. I really need to go; I really need to disconnect from all this. I have been highly intoxicated by society, by life, by loneliness, by civilization. It may have been my fault, but I like to think that I have fucking tried. I have tried to find meaningful and not so meaningful relationships, but this city and this system feed by business, fluidity, and fear systematically distanced me from the people I loved, and avoid those that I could love, to even want to meet me. Numbers and statistics point out that I am not alone in my aloneness. Loneliness is an epidemic. Thanks to Ryan’s books (Sex at dawn and Civilized to death), I am entering in contact again with my bullied human nature. Air, water, food, and people. That’s all. People are highly necessary for my life, and I have lived without them. Spirituality and positive psychology are being swallowed by the system to become tools and mechanisms of keeping individuals inside the workings and gears of this machine. It is obvious that any type of consumption, from sugary and salty foods to entertainment in the form of series, movies, or music are strategies for keeping people distracted from their human lacks. This idea is not new, and I think I was already 16 when I was able to observe this reality. However, now it has become much more subtle and surreptitious, but much more obvious in my case. Things apparently well-intentioned, like meditation, positive thinking, and gratitude are being artificialized and used by the system to make us function in hostile environments. I thought about it when I was on the bike. The idea of keeping a gratitude journal is quite artificial. It is undeniable that it works, because in my case when I have practiced it, I was functioning better, and I could clearly observe the changes in my mood when I was skipping it. However, the fact that seems necessary to keep a gratitude journal with three to five situations or episodes a day would seem utterly ridiculous to a hunter-gatherer sapiens swallowed by a continuous life of social interactions of interdependence. Similarly, with the idea of keeping positive thoughts, hope and optimism have been hijacked. The purpose of positive emotions is working extra hours in order to become successful, open your own business and make money. I mean, money for what? For realizing that you have become socially isolated after years of trading your hours of friendship into meaningless work?. It is a very dangerous cyclical process because once you are isolated, the only meaningful thing to keep you going is working more. I have experienced it myself. After the second time I have masturbated that day, and after five unfinished YouTube videos because none of them is rewarding enough the effort of sustaining my attention for 7 minutes, and the sleepiness insomnia of the thirds siesta, the pointless of going to the street to go nowhere, and the twentieth time of opening and closing the same three apps (WA, FB, IG) without getting any new messages; indeed, the best thing to do with one’s life is doing something pseudo-productive. From time to time, with an encouraging message of any of my friends, I am able to put my shit together, and order my room, have a shower, and go dancing, or work in a standby project. But that is the thing of my brain, and the trap I am protecting myself from falling. It is so easy to self-punished myself, to think that I am making the wrong decision, because here I have the time and the space of working on myself, on stretching every day in my room, of training there, of working on my writing and video projects here in the office, while I am getting paid this high salary for doing a job that takes me one morning a week. And still, I haven’t been able to do it. I need people, I need people and I want to write it because this night while lying on the floor of my office I through that I may regret having left once I am in Zambia and things are not going as good as I expected. I need people. And here, I haven’t had people. And this loneliness is dangerous. It is dangerous because it has made me highly vulnerable. Highly vulnerable to attacks from people like A., that could have deeply and seriously fucked up my life, not only economically and socially, but also morally and legally. Loneliness is an individual problem as much as a public one. Lonely people are those that become lone-wolf terrorists, mass shooters, psychopaths, rapists, abusers. Loneliness and disconnection are the germs, the seed of evil. I cannot buy Peterson’s idea here about individual responsibility when he speaks about mass shooters that hate humankind. Obviously, not all individuals that feel utterly lonely and disconnected from everyone become murderers, but, then, what is the individual responsibility suggested by Peterson? Suicide? Take your shit together and finish your existence. It is clear that it could be something like, go out more, reach out colleagues and previous relationships, and all that. But I would agree with Zizek, Owen Jones, and Ryan on this, and I think it is a by-product of capitalistic, consumeristic society. It is something structural. It is civilization itself. Thus, it is basically my human nature revealing against civilization. I like my case because I think that it is very exemplary. I have more than what many people wish to reach, and I am going to leave it for a fundamental basic human need that is unmet. People can call me crazy, but I dare to say that the crazy would be them if they wouldn’t act like me in my situation. Leaving is the healthiest option at the moment. It’s the most caring one. It is the most adaptive. The surviving one. Buying that capitalistic lie of the system about keep on fighting, keep the struggle going on, keep on sacrificing yourself and your wellbeing for some time, because the reward is around the corner. If you just keep working one, two, three years more, you’ll have 70 thousand euros, and a qualification as a Ph.D., and… so what? If I have to spend three years in this situation just for money and a qualification, it would be difficult to say what would be necessary to happen afterward to make it worthwhile. As I told my friend J. the other day: “The only way of having survived this type of life would have been taking pills every day and becoming a work addict”. And I am already taking pills, each time more often, and little by little becoming a work addict. On the other hand, when I work in things that I feel as meaningful, (like this letter or the video of yesterday), I can use all the power of my ADHD and keep on writing for already 40 minutes straight or editing for about 3 hours non-stop. On the other hand, with a project that doesn’t relate to me, I am unable to go out the bed, drag myself to work, and sit on the desk. Pills help, definitely. But, in my case, I am not sure how justifiable they are. Living with some of my friends, agreeing and committing to some working routines, some daily rituals, keeping track of each other, and investing our time, energy, resources and effort on meaningful projects, would make the pills highly unnecessary. But in this case, I have had to take them to fight back my chronic procrastination. I was trapped in the pattern of postponing the activities and work that I wanted to do because I had obligations to prioritize and that I was procrastinating, to end up doing my obligations at the last minute, to repeat the cycle again without ever finding the time for my meaningful tasks. Now, that I left this job and this house, all I have in front of me is time for my meaningful endeavors. And that is what I am doing. (This letter is part of it). Thus, it is true that the doubts pop up from time to time, but each time they are smaller. I am just suffering from the chronic impatience that annoys me with wanting to leave this hell of loneliness and disconnection as soon as possible. Otherwise, looking forward to my future. Looking forward with a feeling of calm, confidence, and security that things are going to be wonderful that makes me question what is actually going on in my head and my life. Using a more woo-woo language looks like I am learning a lesson from the universe where I am prioritizing love over personal achievements in my life. The universe brought me A., maybe as a warning of what can look like love but is not, and then pushed me a bit more towards a life that is in coherence with my self and my values. The same universe and my life brought me M. and C. back in 2015, and here I am in 2020, going towards them to build a life that I feel I want to live. As I said when I spoke about my landlord in Brussels, I want to live a life with high, big fears. He, having few houses, a highly paying job, and whose family is composed almost completely by a moribund dog, warned me at the beginning of my time in Brussels that, “one day, you are just crossing Rue Defazq, and then a car comes, run you over, and you are done.” Well, he is right. But, fuck, have bigger fears in your life, man, have fucking bigger fears. I don’t give a fuck whether a car can run me down on the perpendicular street from where I live. I don’t give a fuck. I cannot live with such a shitty little fear. I simply cannot. Sunday, I feared that once my community is built, and the temple is working, Zambia is invaded by the Chinese army, and the soldiers took away from us all we have built, that is what I fear. I also fear that I make a huge community of followers that trust my advice and listen to my words, to find out that a psychopath has brainwashed me to commit a massive suicide. Those are my fears. But a car in Rue Defazq, please. I also fear to die without having reached my potential. I also fear living while my projects and ideas die within me. I also fear to die without having written all the words I am here to spread. I fear to die without becoming a performer and having materialized my works of art. I also fear to die alone. I fear many things, things that I was experiencing these years in Brussels. I know that my ADHD will never let me feel completely fulfilled and that sensation of underachievement will always be over me, but at least, I will enjoy my days and my productions with the company of the people I love, not in the miseries of solitude. One of the quotes that struck me the most, that resonated and stuck to my brain, was that one of Sartre, existentialist, that could fight back the absurdism of his contemporaries: [I have spent about 15 minutes trying to find the quote unsuccessfully, so I will write it by hearth. If a future reader knows which one I mean, they can correct me. In the original quote, Sartre (or another author, I am already doubting), manifests that he faces death with calm and tranquility, because when the Death comes to take him, it will only take his empty body, because all that he has to said was said and written.] “I face death with tranquility because when it came for me, it will only find an empty case. All the ideas, the words, the thoughts, the soul, it won’t take it. I will leave in peace knowing that all that was worthy was left in my writings.” (Sort of, Carlito Fluito’s memory) That is the goal in life. A quotation with an approximate message I have been able to find is this one. One is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become. One lives one’s death, one dies one’s life. I feel like reading some serious philosophy now. Maybe I am ready for understanding it. I wouldn’t mind if I weren’t as delayed as I am with so many other personal projects. Who knows…? Maybe in the future. I don’t want Death to come and take me with my words and my life inside of me because I was reading too much philosophy. I have tons to write. So, this is it, B. I feel it as a meaningful job to spend an hour writing to you, understanding my brain, my mind, my psyche, my soul a bit better, and digesting this huge life change that sometimes I don’t fully believe because I am experiencing it without any type of fear or regret so far. Doubts are there, it is true, but once I took the decision, looks like everything is being just an easy, downhill process. I am going to eat, then correct this letter, then send it. Then work a bit on A.’s text. I have one or two things to finish for my advisor before I leave, but, as I like to say to myself, from time to time when I see there is nothing scheduled on the calendar: “Today is a holiday”. 2020-02-12 11.26 Hi again B, Just so you have a taste of my ADHD, I am writing again on the next day without having corrected the letter. The reason, more than the ADHD, is loneliness. I got distracted with a colleague that was going home because she is sick, so I decided to go with her, grab a box for packing my stuff at her place, and then, go home, do the garden, take a nap, read, social media interactions all along, food, call a friend, and procrastinate the whole evening your letter and A.’s text. If I would have had a physical friend telling me to write, I would have done it. If I would have lived a life of abundant high-quality physical interactions with meaningful people, I would set up myself straight and start working. But no, surprise, surprise. I am so love deprived at this moment of my life, that I would take any opportunity to interact, reject many of them that don’t seem promising, and distract myself with social media, books, food, and audiovisual entertainment to avoid accomplishing my duties. My sickness is loneliness, more than ADHD. And, as I hope it has been cleared already, loneliness comes from civilization a.k.a. the system. “The most important ingredient of life is love” The quote on the paper of the Choco Yogi tea given by a colleague minutes ago that I am drinking right now. The book Civilized to death is making a huge impact on my being. Sometimes, I have an idea, and a few pages later that idea is developed or pointed out in the book. It has been really glad to receive the answer of the author on Instagram. It has felt as if I was already becoming relevant enough to maintain conversations with that realm of people: thinkers that think their thoughts are worthy and valuable enough to be seriously spread in a high-quality format. The best I have so far are these letters and the few unfinished works on my website. But it’s coming. I feel it’s coming each time more and more clear. I have a friend that wrote me this morning a message that he was visualizing us working together in dance creations and workshop in the near future. I received also a message from C., one of the sisters waiting for me in Lusaka that is worthwhile preserving. First, the one I sent to her, then her answer. C., I’m talking a lot with M. [her sister] these days, but I know you know that I remember and love you both and E. baby [her daughter]. I just remembered that day we discussed about you telling that you would end up taking Esther and going to live to the “bushes”. It’s funny how I disagreed with you but how now I’m the one that needs it the most, and it seems that I’m ending up bringing you two to the bushes with me. Life is full of lessons. We laugh sometimes at each other’s crazy ideas, but I want to let you know that you are also a genius extremely brilliant wise and creative mind. You are super highly socially skillfully and intelligent with people and that’s is a very important and valuable characteristic in a person. I love you a lot C.!!! Keep it up! Keep on building a huge network in Lusaka, Zambia and southern Africa (with the street mafia and political personages) because great times are about to come… All my love to you, E., M., your brother, the kids, E., and all-around your life. At your feet, C. Humbled by your lessons. ♥️♥ Her answer: You, I don’t know what to say but I feel very confident hearing all this from you… I am humbled… And you are right about my insecurities within… I have learned so much from you and there is no one I have learned and loved to work with more than you, I mean that… We have so much fun, discussing, working and building at the same time, time flew… I can’t wait to work with you again, I know/knew from the first time we worked together we would do something special…I think we grew together and what I lacked you had vs … I love you Carlos and are forever my true brother… My answer to her answer: I just talked with a friend and told him how on point you are when you said “Bro, you are an alien there” (in the phone call of two months ago) and “You seemed like a a genius that was about to lose it” (referring to the Instagram stories of the another day). Only with a sentence, you prove your wisdom. Looking forward!!! You see, B. I told Br. yesterday that it is not a utopia to have and expect this type of love and relationships in our lives. It is actually human nature. Reflecting on myself, I have been always quite an unsatisfied pal, but that is the lack I have felt in my human nature. I refuse to live a love deprived life. I seek to reach a level of love and trust with about 150 people that is comparable with the one expressed by and to C. with these simple messages. And, obviously, I refuse to accept a life where I have to conform to exchange some messages and phone conversations to fulfill my social needs, I want to live in a place sharing my food, roof, activities, education, and purpose with these people. That is why I am leaving to Zambia. That is why I am leaving this job and this house. I have changed the hierarchy of values in my life, and I am prioritizing love. A few minutes ago, a colleague answered the comment of the Yogi Tea quote saying that he thought the water was the most important ingredient in life. Well, I told him, love is probably at the same level of need as water. Actually, I thought that those four needs that I wrote back in 2014 (air, water, food, people) were hierarchical. The famous threes, three minutes without breathing, (three hours in extreme temperatures, cold or heat), three days without water, three weeks without food. Three months without people?. I am not counting sleep deprivation because that is something any being that is not a tortured rat in a lab can do anywhere as much as they need. Thus, air, water, food, and people are those external dependencies that human begins have. But people are indeed relegated as something relatively unimportant in these hierarchies of urgency (the rule of threes). However, I am fed up with all that. I am placing people and love in my life at the same level as oxygen, water, or nutrients. I refuse to accept a life without people. Knowing and acknowledging my unsatisfactory nature, I refuse to have a single monogamous romantic partner, a nuclear family of 3 to 5 relatives, or a bunch of good friends in the distance. I don’t need a whole community for surviving, but I need it for thriving. That is the positive psychology movement. We can put aside survival instincts and needs, and we can focus on thriving tendencies, and activities. Thus, I want a community to belong to. I want a community where I can maintain and nourish love relationships to the level of C. and me, with all the members of the community, no matter age, gender, skills, occupation, ideology or whatever. I want to love and be loved. I need it. I am already envisioning and imagining my life in this community of digital horticulturalists. Working and earning money with an online business, while living as independently as possible from the system with our own rules, sources of food, educative systems, and personalized occupations. One of the main lessons I have learned reading this book is that I cannot save the whole planet, but I can save my community and serve as an example to others to go and build their own communities. I am already thinking about writing a sort of “constitution” with the rules and functioning of the community. Thus, if new people want to join, they can know what to expect. Obviously, we will need someone that is versed on digital marketing, and I personally will need some intellectual discussions for developing my ideas. Just saying. Answering your Facebook comments. (Again, realizing that we talk a lot on Facebook, and not enough on letters…) First of all, thanks for your support and your presence in my life B. You are one of those people that believe in me today when I am still picking up dog shit in my landlord’s patio. I thought about it yesterday. No matter where I reach in life, the people that are believing in me now, are highly valuable social connections to keep into my future. Thus, I keep on saying and repeating to you that you will end up in my community, reading, chilling, writing, improving our SEO, or gardening. Whatever you feel up at a given moment. You say that you are not brave enough to do the changes I am doing, but maybe it is just that you lack the right circumstances. That is why I told you that I am paving the way, so it is easier for others to follow. If I offer you a place to live where I guarantee that I can cover your basic needs in exchange of some work and that I will help you accomplish whatever is your purpose in life, I guess you would be brave enough to live your current situation and come to decide your future and buy your freedom. I don’t want to sound as a sect, or guru, because seats are limited since Sapiens groups split over 150 people. I am choosing nature as guidance, and I will keep its limits as well. Yes, this is the face that people don’t see. The one I have when I feel miserable and lonely. The one that not even the person I am sharing my miseries with can see because when I am communicating my pains, I am already with another being, so my suffering is lower. When I am alone, it is when I suffer. That is the face of my suffering. Yes, I am writing a book not to A., but about A.. She has been a really important person of my life, the one that has connected me with parts of my nature and being that I was neglecting, that has shown me parts of human existence that I was completely ignorant of, that has altered my scale of values, and the one that has made me live an experience enlightening enough to motivate me to actually write and publish a book about it. A. is the next level of poetry in my life, my destructor, and my constructor. The need for destroying my past to construct a brighter future. I won’t dedicate a book to you (yet), but, as you know, I am up to co-author one whenever you feel ready. It would have been good to talk with you on Saturday, but life… Life and civilization. Luckily, I found online the Dutch girl, N., that motivated me enough to go dancing. About finishing my Ph.D., I think I have been clear about it. I feel it is slowing me down intellectually and professionally, apart from isolating me socially. The only thing was money, and money has changed its value since I don’t need it so pressingly anymore. I wouldn’t have minded a couple of months more, but two years and a half, it’s way too much. And that is a lot, especially for someone that wants to work as a dancer and its already 27. I don’t give a fuck about people respecting me or thinking that I am smarter or more worthy of their attention just for being a Ph.D. and have published some academic papers. I am free of that already, B. I will earn my respect and value in other ways. About being chained in your head, you can be as chained as you have time and opportunities of spending time alone. If being in your head is painful and complicated, then, you can write or talk to put part of your head outside of your head. However, if you don’t write because of procrastination or lack of time because you have to work, and you don’t talk because you don’t have access to a person with whom you may feel understood, then, you are indeed pretty fucked, stuck in your head. (a.k.a. write me a letter). The system may follow me, but the key aspect is that I can become as independent from it as possible, more skillful in how I want to use/parasite/benefit from it; and that is tamed and under control. I have decided to stop being used by the system, to start using it. To my pleasures and whims. That is the freedom I am talking about. I am aware of the value of money and some of the commodities of the system. I am also aware of the opportunities. That is why, if I can have a business online, I can use the money to pay for those aspects that I am still dependent on the system, like advanced western medicine, high-technological devices and tools like smartphones and airplanes, or water treatment tablets. However, let’s see how far and independent a community of 150 people with access to the internet, few computers, and a 3D printer can get. About your ADHD, the same story. The sooner you read/learn about it, the better you will start functioning. You are treating yourself with nature, so keep it going. Your present and future relationships can also get improved by you learning about the neurotype. About nuclear energy, I don’t agree. I think it is more important to reshape human needs and adjust them to renewable, decentralized sources of energy. Living in self-sufficient communities fed by solar power, for example. For bigger projects and needs (hospitals, factories, airplanes), that is out of my professional domain, but maybe a bio combustible (if renewables are not enough) could be okay. Also, nuclear fusion seems quite promising, although it wouldn’t make us change our devastating habits, which I think is a more important issue at this point of planetary resources. So, you ask me today, and I answer in this primitivistic, regressive sense. Fewer needs and sustainable energies. Just so you know I am not kidding or daydreaming with all that, we (the sisters in Zambia and me) are already checking lands, locations, and prices. This is coming, B. It is coming soon. So, even if you split with M., make yourself a favor and don’t suicide. Your life will become much better just by taking some decisions and making some changes. Thanks for the compliment about my singlehood. I managed to stay singles because of the overall fear of people in our society, especially women. I know few women that see a good looking, healthy and fit guy in a public space and dare to start talking with him. I also know few women that don’t feel scared if the guy is too straight-forward, weird and it is difficult to understand what he is talking about. I knew few women that dare to transform their ignorance into curiosity when meeting someone new that seems to be knowledgeable about different topics. Much in accord with what a friend of a friend told me once: “I am looking for a woman that has no fears.” In my case, I found one. Her name? A.. After the experience, I am warier if the woman I am meeting has no fears. However, indeed, I am looking for a brave woman. As it is reflected in my answer to C. above, she said that I am “an alien” in this society. In that same conversation, they (C. and M.) mentioned that they had met a girl in Zambia that was like me but in a female version. That was another indicator that my loneliness, as well as my lack of a romantic partner, is probably not originated by lacks and faults in my character, but by the inhabitants of this sickening environment. I don’t have anything against them but understand me when I am having trouble finding people I can connect with here. Indeed, with a girl, or a small group of friends, I wouldn’t have been so miserable, and I would have been able to finish my Ph.D., saving more money, and who knows if even having developed a more “standard” life. But using some woo-woo talking, the wisdom of the universe wanted me to experience what I have the experience to keep this lesson for my life and spread it unto others. I told you that I am a tiring asshole, and still, I think I am. That is why, I feel I need a whole community because if I only have one romantic partner and two or three friends, I can easily drain them all in one bad evening. My family was witness and sufferer of that during my last Christmas when I arrived ready to challenge all their beliefs and undo our subtle catholic indoctrination. My father couldn’t admit that I had ADHD but couldn’t deny that I had been arguing for more than 20 hours in two days, and I was ready to keep it going. Indeed, many of the people here dream of and aim of feeding the system. My goals are escaping from it and change it. So, you can see the differences in priorities. I may have been unlucky or not perseverant enough, and indeed there are wonderful people here with whom I could have been connected, but it is too late for bothering myself with that. I don’t care anymore; I have taken my decision and that is all it matters to me now. You mention: But through feeding the system, they/we feed ourselves. But it is like a really harsh taxing system - you get something, but you have to pay a lot for it. I think dating you and having a good time would consume less energy than breastfeeding this sick system. Check the book, the second title is “The price of progress”. So, you get the idea. Whether dating/living/working with me is more or less consuming than living in this system is something people have to experience themselves. I welcome them if they want to try. The case you mentioned of the couple with the kid and the mortgage for 35 years is not news. God bless them, victims of the system. But not enough time for connections in general. I see it all around me, I do it also. My friend J., which we both love each other and like to spend time together is currently in Amsterdam, a 3 hours bus-trip away from me. I offer him a visit, but he told me he is busy, he has to work, and that there won’t be enough time. Thus, the system sacrificing a social relationship. A very weak example after reading this morning about single mothers in the US that have two jobs to cope with their toddler expenses. But if I want to keep myself away from insanity, I need to stay away from TOO MUCH contacts It depends on the quality of your contacts. Look, you even wrote half a page with two Facebook messages. Image how many could you write if you focus For example, and I know that you don’t like typing and Facebook but I will write it anyway, I know that I am doing a favor to the system by not having contact with anyone except for M and couple of close friends but man… I need to stay focused and I am already struggling with finding a new job, learning digital marketing, reading for the bookstore so I can write the blog, learning this, that… sometimes I don’t have time to sit in front of the computer, play a videogame and drink beer. It is fucked up and I know it is me and my time and my planning, and maybe I shouldn’t drink beer, yes, but hell… it feels good in the evening after the whole day of office sitting and listening to the online digital marketing course. But I am still running every day after work, I am back to this routine and it keeps me going. But to be honest, your ADHD diagnosis for me sometimes feels right, mostly when I see that I need so much more moving in my life (that’s why I like hiking and running - maybe from my kinda chubbiness someone wouldn’t tell, but running is good for me, it keeps my energy in check. Instead of being tired and napping after work, I jump around the apartment and sing and annoy M… sometimes I think M. cannot stand to see me happy wahahahahahahahah Lovely how you describe the self-poisoning as the toll of civilization and loneliness. Your willingness to drink beer and playing video games will likely fade away if you had few friends to play with after “working” on something meaningful. Maybe it would be just a way of clearing out your brain of intellectual work, and balance it with some much-needed exercise. We live isolated and in a really badly designed environment. Your chubbiness can be your genetics, accumulated bad dietary habits, lack of exercise, or many other things. All of that could be easily reversed in the right environment and with the proper habits. Obviously, sustaining healthy habits is a much more enjoyable and easier task when surrounded by supportive people. Looks like fasting is quite good for longevity and overall long-term health. But who is going to avoid indulging in some sugary food after a day of lonely work at the office? After all, we all need our sources of serotonin… If we could put more meaningful relationships in our lives, we could easily cut off poisoning sources of shallow and damaging pleasures in our lives. Just saying. I am confident I could gather the data with a bit of research. Not in the mood, right now, though. I made a small list today waiting for the train, so I will use it. M., as well as most of us, civilized apes, is very likely to be deprived of love/sex/sleep/nourishing foods/fun/free time/nature/fresh air/clean water/meaningful social connections/creative opportunities/social support/loving education. On the other hand, she (as well as us) is likely to have too much food/clothes/commodities/responsibilities/sources of stress/cleanliness/pathogens/material things/information on her life. Compassion to her and all of us that have to bear all these lacks and loads in our current lives. Referring to what I mentioned in our conversation. I used to rationalize my disdain and disgust towards people that had a community. I used to say that they were pack animals, lacking identity, self-reflection, and individuality to recognize their own selves. I always found them too sheep. However, now, I am realizing that these feelings of unease and annoyance were probably a defense mechanism of my psyche originated from my own social lacks. That feelings of belonging to a community that I never had. Something similar happens when I see forever happy couples on Facebook pictures. Thus, I can understand how hurtful can it be for someone that hasn’t had a proper social life, either in the familiar, romantic couple, or community level, to see other thrives. It is that subconscious negative feeling, that destructive jealousy that doesn’t seek to have what the other have, but to destroy what one lacks. I guess A. could relate to this. About many of the other problems that are present in current societies, lack of a community and exclusive monogamic relationships of emotional dependence are two of the main reasons. Mothers and mothers-in-law would be happy about each other in a community of uncertain paternity. First, you don’t know who your mother in law is actually. Second, all potential grandmothers are mothers-in-law, so you would have to either be in bad terms with a fourth of the community or be loved by all of them. Also, when two people have had enough of each other, they usually need some time and some distance from each other to reflect on the situation with perspective. That perspective is given by a third person that you can share your mind with, that can advise you and recommend you what is best for both. Thus, isolating oneself with one romantic partner seems to me a doomed recipe. As I mentioned, the moment now is to connect those alone individuals that are fed up with fighting with their sickening immediate environments, that have realized that this civilization is unsustainable and that are willing to withdraw from the luxuries of materialism in order to connect deeper with their nature as Sapiens. Those people that, once living at peace in their community, would feel the necessity of spreading the message to all those that are still trapped by the system, in order to explain to them how to get out of it and build their own community. I don’t think it is that difficult. And if it is, I will figure it out soon. Thus, find me some “enlightened” that are willing to collaborate on saving themselves and then spread the message to the rest of humankind. I don’t think I am turning “normal”. I hope I am just becoming more “human”, more in line with my real and true nature as homo sapiens. I am glad you become a more “human” loving being after you can connect and express yourself with me. It is a pretty “normal” consequence, though. Finally, here it is the already spoiled closing. I don’t love and hate you. I love you. And I would love to witness how you tackle your full potential. Although, much like me, I guess that you need many people around to reach that stage of existence and levels of performance. I will be waiting. Best of loves, Carlos PS. Start fucking writing. 1.2 2020-02-28 To C. 2020-02-27 17.29 Entering Eindhoven, on the road towards Munster. Hello C., 1.2.1 Before the bus I spend the last day at T. T.’shouse in Antwerp. Today, we ordered his room, went to the city hall to do somepaperwork for his driving license, shop vegan food and cook something quick before I left.It is amazing how materially exaggerated is this country and this part of theworld. So much that it becomes inefficient. That is the situation at T.’shouse, it was the situation in his room, and fortunately, the materialabundance of our groceries will let their parents have something for dinnerwhen they arrive from work. Tom is a great growing young human soul. I met himwhen he was 12, and I was 22. Now he is 18, I am 27. We are both getting older,like everything else in this part of the universe. Today, he received his firstlesson on life organization, how to keep your stuff and living place in order (basically, by going minimalistic), and how to feed yourself and cook,basically, by going fruitarian when you are by your own, and having some basicskills with the pan when you are eating with someone. No big deal. 1.2.2 Yesterday night To keep backward storytelling. Yesterday night, we chill and talk over a cup of tea. Lives, loves, dreams, plans, andinterruptions from the smartphone. The dog stopped barking at me and startlicking my feet. Maybe to erase the last drops of Mortimer’s saliva. We weretired from the training, so we went to bed a bit later. Funny parentheses. In the middleof the night, while I was dreaming, at some point, I woke up and notice apresence in the bed. I moved fast, grab the being and asked: — Who are you? What are you doing here? That being was T. T., whom I had just woke upwith my instinctive reaction. After realizing that I was at his bed, I said: — You are T. T.. Okay. I laughed a bit. — Fuck man… That was weird. I am going to pee. I will tell you tomorrow. So you see. This is my level ofsurviving system. I can sleep on the bed with a friend and wake up in themiddle of the night fully disoriented and ready to fight whoever had invaded myspace. Even when I am the invader. We were tired because we havegone training after being on the shopping mall with P., Tom’s aunt. The training was okay. I saw some old friends, dance a bit, oil my rusty body, andcommunicate with some lovely souls through the phone. Many things are coming,really, really fast. 1.2.3 At the shopping mall Eating with P. in the shopping mall was a peaceful experience at the system. P., like Tom’s parents, works toomany hours for ungrateful people. It doesn’t matter the occupation. I have thatsensation that the average individual of this system works too much, complainsabout it, and then spend the time and the money they earn in ephemeral entertainment and material things that take over living space at their homes. I feelvery sorry for them. Many people of our generation, like you and me, have theopportunity of breaking this wheel of reincarnation and avoid becoming ourparents. We should honor their sacrifice and devote fully into building thebest lives possible for ourselves and those around us. At this moment of life,spending my life doing a job that I don’t like and that is not meaningful forme, it would feel like a huge disrespect to all the effort my parents put intome having the opportunity to reach this point of existence. Also, it would disrespect and disappoint humankind as a whole to waste my potential inexchange of some monthly salary. I have interiorized it so solidly, that it hasbecome part of my nature, of my thoughts, of my beings, of my reality. We ate at a wok place, and thenan ice-cream. I was receiving quite a few messages from different peopleshowing me their love and support and good wishes in my journey. I love toreceive love, and I love to give love. Getting deeper in the understanding ofgive and receive. 1.2.4 Tea at Tom’s place – Future plans I had drunk a tea with Tom’s mother at his place before going to the mall. Talking about future plans. Plansthat can be divided in short, medium, and longer time. However, I would stay atshort and medium because everything is happening way before I expected, and who knows how far and how big we can get. My nextmonths are just a classical trip around Europe. Munster, Holland, Amsterdam,Berlin, Copenhagen. Connecting with lovely people. I don’t care about citiesanymore. That stage was overcame in Agra, India. There I realized that peoplewere more worthy than buildings. No matter how beautiful the building is. AfterCopenhagen, I will stay in Spain. I have to go to the hospital to fix someIndian sequels, and then I plan to visit the south of Spain. It is embarrassingto admit that I haven’t visit the Cordoba’s Mosque, Granada’s Alcazar, or thecenter of Cadiz. I have lived in Jaen, though. (Although, I think that thatyear at University of Jaen, makes my lack of Andalusian tourism even moreunjustifiable). Anyway, we’ll see. That is still open. Something that is closed is thetrip to Ukraine at the beginning of April, and then the dance battle atBarcelona. After that, I was thinking about going to Latvia, to a YouthExchange called Cuddlenation. The objective of the exchange is to delve into physical contact with others. I thought, (and still thinks), that it is a greatopportunity of getting spiritually cleaned from the damage that the lack ofphysical contact of A. caused me. However, they didn’t facilitated muchmy presence there, and it has already happened that organizers of ErasmusExchanges get threatened by me when I pop up there with my tsunami-like personality, my social, creative, and organization skills, and my proactive attitude. I may be too much for them. I am also starting to understand and interiorize this. I don’t care if it sounds boastful or prepotent. I care verylittle about it already. I am realizing that I can communicate from a stagewith a crowd, and in this cases, the conversations would be productive andeffective for both. However, many times I find myself trapped having to explainand defend my approaches and behavior with people that don’t believe in whator how I do things. Thus, I may or may not go. Probably not by the way, due tosomething that happened on the studio during my last night in Brussels. Sort of my own private Cuddlenation. Keep reading. Also, I have the feeling that somany Instagram accounts and “influencers” are shallow, simplistic, and basic,that I have to control myself to not feel annoyed by them. I am already overthem. That level was overcame years ago. I observe their path, and I am happythey are taking it, they are doing it. But, the content they create is not forme. I find it too repetitive, nothing new, no dopamine hits. Just time lost. Thus, after Barcelona’s dancebattle in mid-April, my life is open. I was thinking about going to Formenterafor a bit to write and closing as many Unfinished Books as possible. Also, inthe summer, we’ll see how many of the applications I have sent turned outaccepted. The most important one is the Watermill center in New York City. Anartistic residence of about a month with big players within the artistic world.Participating there would be a huge opportunity to materialize the upcomingprojects in Zambia really fast. Faster than expected. We’ll see. At the latest, I will be landing Lusaka at the end of August. I have agreed to perform in the Zambian Dance Festival my friends are organizing, and giving some workshops there. That would be fantastic since people would see me and getting more dancing works afterwards will be easier. On the other hand, it is a bit of a pity to sacrifice participating as a “priest” in a bonding ceremony that is planned for the same dates. Anyway, I will help with the ceremonial organization of the wedding. In Zambia, I have some things to do. As I told you and P. in the voice note, when I was asked at the Yoga Studio1 what were my plans for Zambia, I asked: writing, dancing, explore my consciousness and explore other’s consciousness. That is it. Simple. Four things, instead of three because of the ADHD, you know. I am going to Zambia to build, to create. The main things to be done are: A community to live in. As you can guess, ecological, zero waste, sustainable, off-grid, as independent as possible from the system/civilization, and with lovely and spiritually advanced souls. Not more than 150 people to keep things in order and organize without the need of developing complicate laws. Ruled by love, trust, generosity, human contact, humor, and mutual cooperation. Digital horticulturalists with the same values and common interests. That would be easy.2 The temple: a spiritually oriented resort. A place to explore consciousness. Somewhere safe where people can come to try diverse practices and approaches to experience different mind functioning and levels of awareness. Different plans considering the background of the people. A basic plan of a week, a luxury premium gold diamond plan to finance comfortably the rest of our projects, and a pilgrim experience with basic commodities and some maintenance work included. There, everyone can chose their desired activities: psychedelic explorations, medicinal plants, aromatherapy, art therapy, gong baths, floating baths, spiritual exercise (yoga, taichi), silent meditations, reiki and healing sessions… Whatever pops up in your mind when hearing the words “spiritual practices” will be available at our temple. It may take more or less time, but it will come. It will grow. The consciousness research center. This is the place where analytics pseudo/super-scientific knowledge will be found. Here, a group of researchers will use the quantitative and qualitative data collected in the community and the temple and, with the help of artificial intelligence, they will untangle the intricacies of the deeper levels of the mind that we understand as spirituality. We’ll need software engineers, programmers, data scientist, psychologists, doctors, physiologists, sociologists, and whatever the -ist you can imagine. We’ll put the academic world upside down. Meanwhile, I will be publishing scientific divulgation books as Non-Ph.D., and performing as Carlito Fluito. I don’t aim to become the guru or shaman of our community since I already know many people way more advanced than me on these matters. On the other hand, I guess I will have a quite leading role in the community, the research center, and some level of organizational management at the temple. So, that is the idea. Visualize with me, and the visions will become truth faster. Coming back to our story. I met T. T. at the Antwerp Train Station. If you have Instagram, follow me to be updated with my journey. I usually post some stories about the different steps. Several layers of meaning and information in each story. It is not my goal to create irrelevance for the shake of irrelevance. I already did that in my 24-hours social media experiment3. I try to cheer up life with some stupidity and from time to time share some useful information. Anyways, the core of my valuable information is shared through my texts and YouTube videos. Go ahead, subscribe, and support. 1.2.5 Last morning in Brussels with K. I slept on the bus from Brussels to Antwerp. Too tired to write. Procrastinating, or merely taking care of myself. I stopped self-punishments anymore, I am just writing for myself. No bosses, no duties. K. came with me to say goodbye at the bus. Like many others, he was really happy for me leaving Brussels, but hurt and sad at the same time for physically distancing us from each other. He is wise as the Dao. He heals by receiving massages, and he is one of the kindest and purest beings I have met in my two years and a half in Belgium. He came the previous week to help me packing, came back on my last night to help to order, and stayed during the morning for the last details at R.’s place. He is wonderful. He deserved heaven. He has a place reserved in the community until he departs and builds his own. K.S PICTURE GOODBY K. and I ordered R.’s house until the last minute, clean up the patio, and close the doors of the place together. I don’t give a fuck what R. complained about the state in which I left the studio. Fully ridiculous. None of my problems. He is over as well. I am assumed my higher level of maturity. My soul is older than his. I cannot get distracted by his childish attitude. 1.2.6 Rituals before starting to dream K., S., and C. slept at my place. They did so because they stayed after dinner and helped me clean. The cleaning was fun: stupid jokes, mansplaining and womansplaining, poo2theloo, the correct degree of physical exert after dinner, and physical tiredness when the task is completed. One of the wonderful things that happened that night was an idea I had had less than a week ago. In my personal ritual at the bath, after raising my vibration with a couple of puffs of marijuana, and filming [“Tutorial: How to have a spiritual experience?”] (ADD LINK!), I had the insight of being in Zambia with my friends, and giving massages to each other in a ritualistic way, at least, once per week. We are all dancers that work with our bodies, and we easily accumulate tension and damage, not only from the physical effort but for the cohabiting dynamics. Sharing a place to live, projects, and occupations can create frictions and eroding positive dynamics between each other. Thus, it is fundamental to have a cleaning ritual with a fixed frequency to get rid of the bad shit and welcome the good shit. One of the most simple, humane, and direct ways of doing so, is to give massages to each other. Normally, a massage of 45 min can cost up to 50 or 60€. However, what is the point of wasting the money you earn in a massage if you have people that can massage you in exchange of massaging them back? That is the point of living in a community. Using the money for obataining the things you really need money to acquire. Not massages, dog sitters, nurses, teachers, psychologists, sociologists, and so on. Please… Come’ on. Thus, after cleaning, I introduced the ritual by saying that, by turns, one person will massage another while telling good things about her and their relationships. K. proposed that the three of us will massage the fourth at the same time (which was an idea I was reserving for later). Thus, we did so. In the beginning, we limited the massage to the hands, to avoid sexual connotations and discomfort, but then, people understood the dynamic, and respectfully we spread the surface to be massaged. The material abundance, Lush free samples, and my dermatitis allowed us to use a wide range of creams and balsams. I was burning a piece of sandalwood in absence of incense stick. Some candles allowed the melatonin to spread comfortably all over our brains, while the oxytocin was flooding our whole system due to the human touch. S. was the first. She was the tryout, mostly a massage on the hands, and lightly on the head, neck, and back. I remind her of the idea I had had a few weeks ago about the alarmasseur, which is the rotating role in the community that is supposed to awake others by giving them a massage. That night was more like, sleepmasseur. I told her some good things about us that she already knew, but is good to hear and say anyways. Love was flowing. Then it was C.’s turn. C. is going to leave the system soon. She also got fed up. We understand each other perfectly. She wants to learn about nature, about plants, about the earth, about permaculture. I told her how wonderful and beautiful her future is going to be; how much she is going to know about non-animal life, and how she is going to support the growth of these supposedly passive beings. Also, I told her that she will come to our community to teach us about plants, but she will do it in a way that adults and kids can participate in the same workshops with stories about vegetables that contain hidden information about how often different plants should be watered, what is their favorite soil, and how you know that the fruit is in the best state to be eaten. Look, I am a hedonist. But I don’t want to waste my hedonism seated watching TV and eating chips. You already know this. I want my hedonism to gravitate around living with wonderful people that love me to the utmost, giving me 12 hands massages, while putting the fresh, bio, ecological fruits that were just picked up from our garden in my mouth. I won’t satisfy with less. And I pity those that do. Until that happens, I will keep drinking water and sacrificing those petty pleasures that people take daily thinking that they are being Bon vivants. I don’t want to be a Bon vivant, I want to be a Bon mourant. I want to die at peace, surrounded by love and pleasures, and I just get there step by step, sacrificing small and superficial pseudo-hedonistic moments to get closer to more meaningful ones. Like the one in the room the other day. Merely with the example of comparing the taste of a supermarket tomato with a fucking real tomato, it is enough to enlighten most people about what I mean. Good luck to you all that chose civilization. After C., it came K.. K. is a dancer, so his massage was more guided, especially in his damaged right ankle. He remembered the story of the day when he got run over by a car before our meeting, and how I ended up in the hospital contacting the people of his dance company. You can imagine the number of wonderful things I said about him. The size and vibration of his soul is something to be experienced. Thanks to him there was an actual dinner, instead of a cleaning gathering. (Keep on reading.) At some point, K. said something that if it catches me high on weed, I would have freaked out to the next level. — Some people repeat their lives in cycles until they find the key, the experience, that allows them to move to the next stage. Fuck, he was describing me. I was there, in Brussels. Saying goodbye to my life, welcoming a new stage. Taking a huge jump forwards, renouncing to a big dream of my past, to a state of comfort and commodity, risking a lot. And still, it all felt wonderfully correct, peacefully right. I was doing what I was supposed to do. I was enacting it and embodying it. It was possible, it was happening. It was my last night in Brussels, I was with three other lovely souls giving and receiving love after a wonderful dinner, and a session of cleaning. It was that moment and that sentence. It was happening. I had found the key to move to the next stage of my life. Fuck, it was happening. After I freaked out for a bit and told K. how wise he was, and how he was able to heal people while receiving massages (You will see when he is giving you one …, S. said), it was my turn. I was really looking for my moment, and I had a few things very clear by then. I wanted to lay down. My body was damaged on the neck (which had cracked a couple of times while I was massaging others), my right wrist and ankle, both trapezius, and of course, feet, face, and hair for the sake of pure pleasure. Also, my hips are kind of locked, but that is something I have to work on through hours of yoga. I played some Ohms and warned my masseurs that I won’t be able to tell them to stop. So, I made them free to stop whenever they wanted before they started. I peed, wash my face, my nose and my mouth (Next time we’ll shower before starting, I thought), took off my shirt and laid on the floor. S. took my face, K. went to my ankle, and C. focused on my hands. As K. had mentioned, and S. and C. had agreed, it was a great feeling to experience how the three masseurs are connected through one’s body. I felt it then. I try to relax, focus on the Ohms, focus on the touch, focus on the feelings, just sink down. I enjoyed the experience. However, my relationship with my body asks me for high intensity. When I am able to jump, flip in the air, and land perfectly, I celebrate it for a few times before I move to the next acrobatic movement that I am not able to perform. When I am lying down with ohms, good smells, filled stomach, my house is clean, I have three lovely friends massaging my body, and nothing else to do in my life than relax and enjoy; I try to fully surrender to the experience, but sooner or later my brain will come back to think about things that are not working perfectly, details that can be improved, and future plans that will be even better than the current moment. I prefer to blame my ADHD brain than myself and fully acknowledge that this is what my current existing life is about. Few days ago, I had the intuition that I will reincarnate in a tree for the next live. You know, just acknowledging that I cannot move, talk, or do much, other than letting myself be moved by the wind… I guess that the universe is balancing consciousness and teaching them how to perform any state of existence possible. Anyway, this is the life where I have to be talking. So I talk; so I write. K. tried to fix my hips, C. relaxed my calves, and S. moved to the neck. A bit later, C. and K. started to massage each other, and I hugged and thank S. for the massage and her presence. I asked her to cover me with my merchandising t-shirt: [“Truth is non-violent”](ADD LINK!!), and then, asked her to try to unlock a muscle contraction on the back, and the beginning of tendinitis in the right shoulder. After a while, S. was tired, so I offered her to go to bed and I would massage her until she would fall asleep. — That’s the best idea you’ve had since I know you. Better even than going to Zambia I took the clothes of my trip out of my backpack and offer them to my guests as pajamas. I left some beddings available if K. and C. wanted to sleep on the carpet, and also offered them the possibility to go up the bed. The mattress was big, and we could all have fitted. I went up and massaged S. for a bit, while I was talking about the research center and how the people in our university would have to quote our studies, and how our impact would be much higher than whatever the studies they were doing at the UCLouvain. We also talked about monogamy, and how ridiculous all those people that limit their physical, erotic, and emotional love to only one person would look like. We joked about the average size of a Zambian penis, and how we, white European guys would have to cool down our egos. We dream together in the bed before going to sleep. We fall asleep hugging each other, giving and receiving love, holding our hands, in my favorite sleeping position, with her head in my chest… Before sleeping, I tried a brief spiritual exercise. I have been practicing different techniques these days, and specifically, I am doing the [Unlocking Transcendence Course by Jeffrey Allen](ADD LINK!) at the [Mindvalley platform](ADD LINK). At this moment of the course, the exercise is about visualizations and contact mentally other people. I do it for explorative purpose, trying to remain openminded, and not scaring the shit out of myself when something difficult to believe fucking blows my mind up. Thus, there in bed, I tried to contact [Jeffrey Allen] (ADD LINK), himself. I saw myself surrounded by a grey bunch of viscose things. They felt like lives, consciousness, people. I was moving around a realm and dimension where the souls reside. I was serpentining this space, moving around this consciousness, and little by little there was more space to move. It was easier to move, and I was getting closer to my objective. But I arrived at someone else. I didn’t find Jeffrey Allen, it was another person. It was [Christopher Ryan] (ADD wikipedia LINK), the writer of Civilized to Death @[key], the book I haven’t fully finished yet. It was difficult to maintain my attention without losing the whole trip, and once there, I tried to communicate with him and express my gratitude and love. I am not sure whether I fall asleep after that, or I recovery normal consciousness on the bed, next to S.. I had the words of my friend C. on my mind concerning how important it is to feel like a protector when you are sleeping with a girl on the bed, and how I didn’t do it when I had the opportunity of sleeping with Sh., back on my days in Salamanca.4 Therefore, I remained lying down on the bed, half awake, half slept. There, I dreamed something very easy to interpret. I was surrounded by people. My group, my tribe, my community. Then, S. and I were kissing, and somehow her tongue reached my throat and I waked up choking on the bed. However, I was able to come back to the same dream easily.5 In the dream, I expressed S. my physical limitations, and how she had reached a point where I had to express my individuality and respect myself. However, one of the characters on the dream told me that I was a coward, that I had to go further, that I didn’t dear to go beyond. Then, I realized that that character was a psychopath. My experience with A. has equipped me with a whole set of skills and a new awareness to detect and fight emotional and psychological abuse. There in my dream, I detected her almost instantaneously when, after expressing my limits, that person pushed me to go over them right away, even when they were risking my life, since I had almost chocked. At that point, I confronted the psychopath with her behavior and attitude, and I told her to leave us all, explaining the rest of the group why she was a psychopath and what she was doing. After her trying to confront and menace me, the group agreed with me and she was forced to leave.6 After a while, the same character entered the room again, this time in the form of a big male figure. Still a female inside, though. Then, I stood up holding a small girl on my arms. Looked like I was the leader of the group, I was the protector. S. wass my lover at that point, and that girl wass probably my daughter. The rest were members of my tribe. We were all together, we were a unity. I felt so confident about myself and my group, holding that girl, feeling the warmth of her body, her cute little arms around my neck and shoulders. I could just face that devil. Face to face towards the psychopath, I told him/her: — Come’ on, hit me. Show them all who you really are. Show them that you don’t care to hit me. Because if you hit me you will be hitting her. I was referring to the kid I was holding in my arms. Humans are able to see clearly the evil when is directed towards vulnerable beings. As S. pointed out in the morning when we woked up and I shared my dream with her, I was basically using the girl as a human shield. However, I think that is a very mundane interpretation. I was betting high, true; but I was protecting myself, that daughter, and my whole tribe from the dangers of that psychopath. I was unmasking him/her, in front of everyone. I was playing harder than the psychopath itself. Psycho vs. psycho. Fire against fire. In the dream, the psychopath realized the trap. S/He felt how much s/he wanted to physically attack me and how hard was to contain him/herself from doing it, but it would have been too obvious if s/he would have done it. Also, the tribe was scare because if s/he did it, s/he would harm the kid. At some point, S. stood between the psycho and me. — If you hit him, you will also have to hit me. Other people start to standing. – And me. – And me… The psycho realized that s/he had lost the battle. Then, we had the psychological and physical power to tear him to pieces. We started invading his/her physical space, making him/her retire, go backwards, while we grabbed his beard, and walked confidently and aggressively towards him/her. S/he eventually left the room again7. Then, we started celebrating our victory, and after a while of enjoying the loyalty of the group, R., the landlord of the house appeared with a set of hitting things. He had baseball bats, cricket hammers, golf sticks. It was like if he was showing his aggressive and material wealth at once. It seemed that the psychopath had gone looking for help and R. had came to the rescue with his whole set up of tools. It felt a bit as when two males show off in front of each other, displaying the potential of her bodies before entering into combat. I had my tribe. We had each other and ourselves, and R. had his tools. Since I was the leader of the group, I was attentively listening how the situation evolved. Some of my people were talking with him, explaining what had happened. However, I felt the fear of those that talked with R.. I still had the girl on my arms. I started to speak and I reasoned with R., that since he had only two hands, it would be fair that any one of us in the room would get something to occupy their hands with. Somehow, a black irregular maze (maza como en las cartas españolas) materialized at my hands, and I told everyone that they can take a thing from R.’s display of instruments. Once we are all armed and ready, I saw how R. himself had also armed and protected, wearing a butcher [delantal], boots and gloves, and a huge knife in each of his hands. He had more sharpen tools than us, but we were more. My tribe was ready to fight. There would be casualties due to R.’s tools, but it would be an easy victory. Before the combat started, I pointed out that S. hadn’t gotten any weapon. Before she chose I asked R., — What would it happen if now S. takes a smartphone, calls the policemen, and find all your tenants armed like this against you in these situations? Who would they protect?** R. looked at himself dressed as a butcher with a couple of huge knives at his hands, with raging eyes thirsty of blood, and the crazy psychopathic look at his face switched to one of surprise and self-awareness when he realized the trap that he had fallen into. The dream was over. I think it is quite easy to interpret. The power of the group, the symbolism of the loyalty of my lover, the fatherhood of holding the little girl, the leadership of the tribe, the resolution of problems, the detection of the psychopath, the material wealth accumulated on R., but unseful due to human limitations (only two hands), how once the wealth is distributed, even when the materially rich person is better armed, the socially loyal group is going to win the battle hands down, and the usage of civilization tools like the police in favor of small groups and against advantageous individuals within the system. To a more personal level, R. is R., and I am taking back my power and my freedom from him, and the psychopath is a representation of those people that try to manipulate me other than A., as it happened in the dinner. At this point of life, I am ready to enter into new battles, I am armed with psychological defenses that I can use as attacks. I am armed with a certain degree of material wealth that allows me to fight back the unfairness of this planet. I am building my tribe, my community, my team of loyal people that are willing of putting their life at risk for me. I am ready to love and be loved. I am close to being able to parent of a new human being. Dreams are full of information. The fact that scientific psychology has undervalued them, just point out how little the field knows about human consciousness. I don’t care about the generalizability of results or quantitavization of psychological phenomenon. I don’t care whether you can measure it or not. I am caring about what the fuck my consciousness is trying to process and communicate with me, what the fuck my consciousness is able to experience. If it is not scientifically replicable enough for you, believe me, I don’t give a fuck. Anyways, much of what “scientific psychology”\" produces is not replicable either. 1.2.7 Pot de depart I had arranged to meet D. and C. on the center that evening, but I had still lots to clean at my place. I had also agreed to meet M. at my place. I was supposed to meet K. to give him the bike he had bought me, and S. wanted to see me once more to say goodbye. An., the flatmate had told me that she would come at some point to help me clean. I woke up from the siesta sort of disoriented. I couldn’t focus much, and I was moving around trying to figure out what was left to be cleaned, what things should I put on the backpack and what things I didn’t need. While I was texting D. and C. to change the location of the meeting and told them to come to my place, my doorbell rung. M. had arrived at the same time as R., so I say hi from the door of my studio. M. came up, and I explained to her the situation. More or less. She started talking about her experience studying psychology at the university, and I very much understood how she was approaching and living it. Good professors, bad professors. Sometimes learning cool stuff, sometimes feeling like wasting time and life. She has to write me a letter, so I will wait until she does. I didn’t have much to offer, but I had some tea bags left. During our conversation, K. called and told me that he was coming and that he was buying some stuff for dinner. Perfect. I think Mohammed called me as well to tell me that my advisor had expected me to go to the office that day. I had to wait for the transport guy to come for the package, so that wasn’t in my plans. A bit later C. arrived. I introduced M. to C., letting them know that there were no chairs at my place and that more people were coming as well. M. was seated on the fitness ball, and I turned the garbage bin upside down as an improvised chair for C.. It was good to catch up with C. and get to know that she was also following the path outside of civilization. Si. called me but it wasn’t the moment to talk. S. sent me some voice notes that I half-heard. She was coming as well, a bit stressed and tight with the time. C. and M. were getting along, which gave me more time to organize my stuff around the room. I was also giving them extra pens, and lighters that I didn’t know what to do with. D. arrived. C. and D. knew each other already. I introduce them to M., and that gave me even more time to focus on my own stuff. A bit later, K. arrived. No one was expecting no one, and I hadn’t planned anything either. Things were just happening as they were coming. There weren’t enough tea bags for everyone, so people were sharing the bags and glasses. K. said that if I would have told him, he would have bought more food. I didn’t care since I didn’t have any food, and whatever he had was perfect, because we would all share it and eat something. We started cooking and the vibe got more friendly and lively. An. arrived dressing a big pullover and leggings, ready to clean, when she realized that there was a sort of party going on. Excepting C. and D., no one knew each other from before. When S. arrived, I told her that there was a Fiesssta going on and I asked her to guess how many people were in my room. — Eight, she said. — Come on, S.. I am the most fucking lonely guy in Brussels. I don’t have friends. She entered the room and saw M. and K., C. and D. had gone to An.’s to see her collage made of traveling pictures. They came back with some cake, and we set up the table. The dinner was ready, and S. had brought a bottle of wine. There were some interruptions with some smartphone calls. An. told me to ask Su., the other flatmate to join us. She couldn’t, skype call time. Everything was ready, and I asked for the attention of everyone. — Today is my night. I am the protagonist and my ego is skyrocketing. D. had bit already the food, although I told him to wait. — I control everything except my impulses, he answered. At some point, Mortimer entered the room and we took a lovely photo with all of us. INSERT PICTURE Before starting the dinner, I told them that I would read a tale I had written the previous day. It was in Spanish, so some people would understand some parts, and, some people would not understand anything. However, there was some sonority on the text, so everyone could enjoy it at some level. Also, since there were some complicate and very niche words, not everyone would understand everything. I would read the tale, we would cheer, and we would start the dinner. An. entered the room and I had to explain the rules again, being interrupted by her and her Elevator speech advice. — Patience and silence, I told her. That was the opening ceremony and the blessing of the food. Here is the tale: Mortimer El árbol había dejado de intentar moverse hacía ya muchos años. Había interiorizado que no iba a crecer más. Había asumido su silencio. A sus pies nació un pequeño diente de león. Primero las hojas espinosas y planas. Luego, poco a poco, el tallo. Más tarde se empezó a formar el vilano aparasolado del que salieron infinidad de cipselas. Vino el viento. Embriaga de vanidad y dolor, la pequeña planta no admiró la belleza de las livianas cipselas que se elevaban y revoloteaban dibujando volutas y movimientos Brownianos, envolviéndose en el leve vaivén de las ramas del árbol. Tampoco escucho el secreto que el viento confesó al protagonista del cuento. Un tiempo más tarde, entraron los propietarios de la finca. Era finales de octubre. Talaron nuestro árbol y todos aquellos de su alrededor. El diente de león sobrevivió la masacre anegado por el último y tibio orín de un can moribundo que edulcoró las raíces del abeto, el cual experimentaba sus últimos instantes de consciencia. We started eating. A. told me to invite R. which was, indirectly, the person providing the house. I agreed to tell him, but he refused saying that he had already eaten. K. had bought some meat forgetting about my dietary preferences. S. re-interpreted my fruitarian attitude saying that I am not crudi-vegan, but crudi-vagoncio8. She is probably right. Going frugivore is becoming minimalistic in the diet: less and fast shopping process; minimal cooking operations limited to peeling and blending; money saved; planet saved; better health, etc. At some point, I was feeling elated by the moment, and I admire how this people that didn’t know each other were sharing the floor because of the absence of chairs, eating from a few plates on a piece of wood lying on a box, sharing cutlery, food and wine I hadn’t bought, in a place that wasn’t mine, and that I was leaving the next day. It all felt lovely surrealistic. I said that it was the first time so many people came to that place. Later on, while cleaning I would say that it was the best goodbye party ever.9 At some point, I joked: — The strategy is to say to people that you are going to clean and then make the dinner. If you invite people for a dinner, everyone comes. But if you invite them to clean, then you know that only the best ones are going to come. It was quite accurate though. Later on, I felt like sharing my impression of the dinner that was going on and comparing it with R.’s standard dinner. — So, as all most of you know, my landlord is a guy that has money and likes luxury and all that, yes? So, he had dinner the previous weekend and… Then, I got interrupted by A.. — Carlos, don’t talk about other people when they are not in front of you. That is not of good taste. — Well, I am not talking about him. I am just making the comment of comparing this dinner with one of his dinners, for example, the one that happened a few days ago… — Yes, but you need to learn how to adapt to all situations. She interrupted me again. I was losing my patience. — I am not saying that I cannot adapt to both situations. For example, I ate with him at Christmas two years ago, and I had fun. And I am not even talking negatively about R., I am just pointing out to the objective differences that are between these two situations that differ in the level of material wealth, and I would like to reflect on the social consequences of these two situations. For this, I would like to use this current dinner and last weekend R.’s dinner as an exemplary situation due to the irony that both of them are happening in such proximity in both time and space. But that is all. — Yeah, but you have to be comfortable in any condition where people are different and speaking about different things. — Well, that is interesting, because the fact that I am trying to talk about this and you don’t let me talk about what I want to express is pointing out that there is something in this situation that you are not adapting very well to. So, I could mirror you and be a bit psychopathic, pointing out at your behavior right now and telling you that you are uncomfortable here because I want to talk about this topic but seems you are not leting me doing it. — Don’t mirror me, because I am reading the Laws of Power, and I am very aware of what you are doing and I don’t allow when people don’t let me say what I want. — So I am saying the same. I tell you and I ask you to stop interrupting me and let me talk of whatever I want to say. As you can see, A. gave me psychological superpowers. The strategy of being overly presumptuous and verbose when I am interrupted due to the content of what I am saying and develop an elaborate objectivization and theorization of the examples I wanted to use were already in my arsenal of dialectical weapons. However, that subtleness to mirror once and even twice to a person, just to let them know that the problem is in them and not in me, is something I learn by suffering it. When you are trying to explain to a psychopath that her behavior is harmful using non-violent behavior for a whole weekend, you fucking get the grasp of the way she is communicating with you. The energy in the room changed10. Everybody noticed the energy and the vibe in the air. A. remained silent, I briefly expose the topic saying that I just wanted to compare both dinners, and I explained S. how we, seated on the floor, sharing cutlery and plates and eating with bread directly from our hands dipped in the bucket of yogurt, was likely having a bonding effect on the members of the dinner. On the other hand, at R.’s dinner, everybody has its first, second and third plates, with different cutlery for each part of the meal, and at least two or three glasses depending on the offer of liquids. At that point, I drunk straight for the bottle of wine in the name of materialism. Some minutes later, a more cautious A., asked me for the paper with the tale and Mortimer’s picture in the background. I handed it to her. It was clear that I had earned not only her respect but likely a higher position of power in that specific social situation. A. is a very kind and smart person. She is highly intelligent and a person of a wide reading. However, as many of us ADHD’ers, she needs to train her patience, self-awareness, the impact she makes on other people, and sometimes her humility. I don’t want to rejoice on the elevator speech advice, but she could shorten up her stories about her endless trips around the world, speak louder, and in a more organized way, and allow people to finish their messages without interrupting them. Just feedback, in case this letter reaches karmic levels. As I said to a friend today, now that I am free, I can write whatever the fuck I want about whom I want and in the way I want. I am over everything. More dangerous than ever. Anyone to be accountable to, no one to give explanations about anything. Even further, the number of people that are able to sustain a conversation that keeps my interest and widens my perspectives is being reduced. Of course, you can learn something from everyone, of course, each person is unique and deserve respect, love, and appreciation as a human being. However, as I pointed out, I don’t care if it sounds arrogant or not, I have realized that I can talk to audiences, but it is likely that a big number of people are not going to talk with me. I liked the Dandapati metaphor of using one’s energy wisely. The energy is not supposed to be wasted and spilled everywhere but directed in meaningful tasks and invested with meaningful people. I am very happy that I have readers that grow and feel identified with my texts. But I have to be cautious with how I use my personal and private time, and how I spend my already problematic attention. That is not undervaluing others, it is just respecting myself.11 The dinner continued. People were filled up thanks to K.’s groceries and A.’s cake. I was half-drunk due to S.’s wine, and delving into a conversation about stupidity and meaningful things with S.. It was getting late and people started leaving. M. had to leave, then D., then A.. They asked a couple of times about the cleaning and I told them that they shouldn’t worry that we would deal with it. I also offered them to stay and sleep but they preferred to leave. Therefore, K., C., S. and me, were left. We talked a bit more, and we went out of the talking mood and philosophizing conversation the only way possible, introducing them to John Oliver and his last piece about Narendra Mudi, just to listen to the new hit of the moment: [Take the poo to the loo](Link). After laughing like monkeys at the image of some shits playing cards on the street, we decided it was time to clean. C., the Kitchen; S., dusting the wardrobes, and K., who was supposed to relax because he had bought and cooked the food, ended up being the multifunction helper. I cleaned the bathroom. 1.2.8 Crashing at the top After leaving the yoga studio and sent and audio to P. because, I didn’t want to go straight home. I felt like taking one last symbolic picture. One in a beautiful place in Brussels but not the typical tourist non-original thing. I wanted a unique one, one that would be representative of the step on life that I was leaving and what had I gone through. The idea came pretty much by itself, without the need of thinking much. I arrive to the top of Monts des Arts, pedaling with vigor and sweat as I had done many nights when I was coming back from the center with the bike. It was that hill or the hill that ends up at Place Lousie. There, I saw the tourist, I saw the tower of the city hall, standing beautifully, elegant and unbalanced. My first tinder date on Brussels, a beautiful architect that stop replying my messages, like so many others would do after her, told me the story of the architect of the city hall, and how he had decided to jump from the top of it when he realized that the main door was located slightly towards the left affecting the whole symmetry of the front facade12. I found the tale dramatically significative and beautiful. That guy had decided to kill himself out of perfectionism. He couldn’t stand seeing his imperfection on a daily basis, no matter how wonderful the end result was. He just jumps one day from the top of his own construction. In my case, I just thought about the stupidity and the funniness, of a face against the rock at the top of that structure with the beautiful landscape on the background. That day, I started to use the line: Hello, can I ask you for a picture? I am a weird guy, so, it is not a normal picture. People find it funny, and in the case of the mother and her son that took the photo, they even complimented my t-shirt. I might be on fire that day since I was receiving so many compliments. I hadn’t carried out the marketing strategy to sell all the t-shirts that I had at home because a Story to be told in another moment13, but it was sort of a signal from the universe that it won’t be difficult to sell the t-shirt once, I would get a bit serious with the enterprise. The picture was also inspired by my friends from Losin’Form Alls, Fruta y Pera, and their joke of “el estampao”. I unconsciously entitled the picture, “Crashing at the top”, because that was the story I had lived. I had everything an average person could have asked for: a well-paid, self-managed job; a house where I could live for free; a city with a huge scene of contemporary dancers; a high-level bboy community… And still, I had felt very miserable and lonely there. I have crashed as I hadn’t crashed in all my life. I was at that top on life, and still, the forcefullness of my impact had been incomparable. Feeling like a Full-time artist, I head home stopping by Le Café Quotidien where the friend of a Brazilian girl that I kissed in a party told me to pass by whenever I wanted because he would invite me to an espresso coffee. That guy had driven me home, together with her girlfriend, a small and cute Brazilian girl, and my crush of the night, that after kissing for a while with me started to feel the whole alcoholic intoxication. — Well, I didn’t know I was such a bad kisser, what can I say? I helped them carry her to his car, and hold her head while seated on the back seat of the car. The guy said I was very friendly, honest, and a gentlemen for what I was doing. I just wanted a lift home and consider the night over. I had been playing psychopath at the bar, remaining serious, silent, and observant, without smiling, just making eye contact with the people and analyzing their behaviors. Interestingly, that strategy attracted many girls, almost as much, if not more than smiling, being funny, and easy-going. The Brazilian girls came, danced next to me, and a bit later, we kissed. Easy. Too easy to be true, consider what happened afterwards. Anyways, the guy of the Pain Quotidien wasn’t there. No espresso for me. I hadn’t slept much packaging things, so taking a nap would be also a proper investment of my time. I went to the bank, withdrew some money for the float of my landlord, then go home. I left 46.07€ inside the box, because I was so rich and wealth, that I didn’t mind donating one cent to the finances of Lord. R. R.. Then, keeping the circular dynamic, I ate my last can of white beans bought in Colruyt more than 2 years ago, just with a spoon, uncooked, and straight from the can. I always loved the feeling of being a beggar, of being outside the system, of not caring what people may think. I was eating those Colruyt cans in the office of my university as well. Brussels did what it’s only capable of doing with the weather. After a sunny and clear day, a healing storm fell. I was trying to make my nationalistic picture with the coins from the float money when the storm came. The picture was mostly inspired by the talk I had had with a nationalistic half-French, half-Spanish youngster studying in Brussels. I tried to explain to him that exerting physical violence (police intervention from the Spanish state) against symbolic violence (attempt of voting during 1st of October in Catalonia) was unfair and disproportionated. He didn’t get nor my arguments about historical identity, neither how, according to Harari, Spain, as any other cultural fiction, was only existing in people’s minds. He was only feeling heated and offended by the fact that some people had manifested violently by blocking off roads, occupying airports, or screaming on the streets. He considered that physical violence against symbolic polls was the right thing to do when the unity of a nation (a cultural fiction) was at a stake. When he asked me about politics, I told him that Podemos’ ideology next to mine was conservative and that I was a whole anti-system individual. So much, that I had already leaving the system, and motivating others to follow the trend. I was fully applying Zizek’s highest expression of violence. He ended up the conversation with few “¡Arriba España!” because of yes. Well, Spanish politics seems such an alien thing to me already. The storm caught me in my room, with the can of beans on my hands and some wet coins ready to be photographed. I took the photo, finish the can, and took a siesta. I woke up a while later, remembering that I had arranged some visits for that evening. 1.2.9 Circular transitions at the yoga studio As I said to P. in the audio, a few things happened when I went to the yoga studio where I used to work to give back the key I had found while ordering my room. The one I had been trying to take there for more than a year. Once I left the house, I went to the foreigner’s office to unenroll from the Belgian system. There I met a Spanish dancer and I told her to contact K. and ask him about the list of dance spots in Brussels I have done at the beginning of my time in the city. I waited in vain because I was supposed to go to the commune. I went there, and whatever the negative things people can say about Belgium and its organization, in my personal experience, bureaucracy has been pretty smooth pretty much all the time. Entering the building, taking a ticket, waiting a reasonable amount of time, going to the desk, and having the issue solved in just a few minutes. Simple and effective. Coming from Spain and its style of Did you brought this and this paper…? But you know that it is not here where we do this procedure, you have to go to this place… Yes, sorry, now it is closed, it is holidays…; I found Belgium quite resolved.14 Thus, in less than 15 minutes, I was out of the system. I head towards the post office and I joined the laughs of the attendant at my original way of packaging. I spent 13€ to send a small box to a friend in the UK. Considering that I had sent two boxes of 30 and 35 kg to Spain that same morning, the price of that package was ridiculous, but you may have heard already about previous experiences with the Belgian post services.15At this point in life, I have the money. I didn’t complain. I paid, and I let it done. Easy. I felt lighter after the package was taken and the bureaucracy finished. Everything was going downhill. I took the bike that was still mine, and in a metaphoric way, I went from Port de Namur to the Theater of La Monnaie, the road I had taken so many Sunday mornings at the beginning of my period in Brussels when I was waking up after 5 hours of sleep because I had to clean the bar at Hard Rock Café until 3 am, and then give my yoga lesson at 9 on Sunday morning. I don’t buy that bullshit of working hard for other people and struggling to reach your goals, and those modern coaching messages of empty motivational quotes. However, I can say confidently that I have earned my position outside of the system. The bike was fast. It was the first time I was taking that route with that bike. All downhill, just being careful not being hit by a car and braking before the curves. As always, creatively and dangerously ignoring traffic signalization of all kinds, and arriving at my destiny in less than two-thirds of the estimated time by Google maps. At the entrance of the studio, I left the bike unlocked outside. I took the key from my pocket, and to the surprise of the girl seated at the desk of the reception, I locked the glass door from outside. I just wanted to be sure that it was the right key and not another one from somewhere else. I unlocked the door and entered the place to the surprise of the people there, explaining out loud that I used to teach there more than a year ago. Indeed, it was all quite symbolic. That place had been one of the first jobs I got in Brussels, if not the first. It had been one of the places that had treated me best, and the solidification of my role as a paid yoga teacher. However, once I started with the Ph.D., I had to stop giving lessons, because it was in conflict with the contract from my university16. As, I explain to P. in the audio, it was the key that was closing the cycle, the first and the last job-related thing I was doing in Brussels. Once inside, the volunteer at the reception was a kind and affable Greek woman. I explained to her the situation with some more details, and then I took a glass of tea and looked at my smartphone while I waited for the tea to cool. I had posted my video crying on the room on the feed, breaking all the nice patterns that I have gotten thanks to my collaboration with B. and M. on the social media. Thus, I made a screenshot and the story My life is broken now. In a video where I am crying, people may think that my life is actually broken. However, I was merely referring to the brokenness of the Instagram feed, which for some people it actually represents their life. Anyway, the whole thing looks weird and messy now, but I don’t care. I will fix it at the right moment. In any case, more than broken, my life was getting recomposed. Most of the yoga students went to their classes and the Greek receptionist and I were kind of force to interact. It was a yoga studio, so normally we understand each other, and we are alternative, spiritual people that are not going to get judged as it might happen at Luxembourg square. She started the conversation with a typical accepted question: — What are you doing in Brussels? I quickly made the conversation atypical, as I always do: — Well, I am leaving. — Are you traveling or something? — No. I was working here two years ago, so I have been living here for two years and a half already. — Then, what have you done in Belgium during this time? That was the question I couldn’t answer at that moment. When I face difficult questions that require complex answers I usually take my time to came up with a satisfactory answer in terms of length and accuracy. For example, once someone asked me why I didn’t like Belgium, and I answered that we didn’t share the same values. In the yoga studio, I didn’t want to come up with any thinking process, and since my impulsivity and spontaneity were fully functioning, I answered: — life, life, life, life… Actually, there was quite a lot of life. I hadn’t verbalized yet how much I have lived in Brussels during this time, and it is undeniable that in two years many things, many people, many processes, many moments, many situations happened. — Okay, she answered. And where are you going then? — Well, I will do a small tour around Europe visting some friends. But the final destination is Lusaka. — Lusaka? I don’t know where is that. — Don’t worry, I didn’t know it either until I check. It’s the capital of Zambia. — Zambia? That is Africa. — Right. — And what are you going to do there? — Similarly, what could I say… Live. She laughed. — Well, I am afraid I need some more specific information to understand. I laughed as well. I tried to be as concise as possible: — Dancing, writing, explore my consciousness and study other’s consciousness. She seemed intrigued, but she clearly understood. — I see, so you are planning to build a project there. — That is correct. — Well, that looks nice. I hope everything goes well with you. — Thank you. It has been some intense period. If you have some social media, you can follow my trip. What is your favorite app for distant communication? I have all the apps. I was wishing she said Instagram. — Hmmm. Instagram could be fine. — Perfect. Then you write “Fluito”, and you should be able to find me. I have been uploading many stories about these days, packing and all that. Now they are gone, but I will make a compilation with the best moments for YouTube. — Hmmm. Wow, spiritual psychologist, that sounds deep. — Haha, sort of. You know exploring the consciousness and all that. — I like the “Non-Ph.D.” thing. So, you didn’t finish your Ph.D. — Well, I didn’t. I wrote it because of Zizek, do you know him? It is a Slovenian philosopher that uses an example about the living and the death, and how the non-death is this space in between. They are not dead, but they are neither living. They occupy that space in between and that makes them from a different category. It is this idea that the negation of a characteristic that forms part of the identity of the object. Something like this. I don’t understand much of philosophy. He even gets more complicated with the negation of the negativity, because it is the non-death. In my case, it is just that I am a non-Ph.D, I point out that I don’t have a Ph.D., but it is not merely that I don’t have a Ph.D.; I have a non-Ph.D. — Hahaha. Interesting. I see. So what was the topic of your research? — The effects of nature on morality. — Sounds cool. — Well, it sounds cool. But then, it is a different thing. People outside academia think that having a Ph.D. is very cool and that we are very smart or something like this. Well, I am not. I think that the job is easy, but I cannot say anything because I didn’t finish. Anyway, the thing of doing a Ph.D. is that it is a bit reiterative, always about the same topic, small field, and then big conclusions. My mind is not done for that, I like big ideas, mixing things, stretching scientific knowledge and try to link it with spirituality. That is more interesting for me. I accepted my nature, and that is what I am good at. I don’t want to be in an office, looking at the screen and all that, system, system, civilization, society… — Yes, I understand. — Thanks. Enough of my ego. Sooo, what are you doing in Brussels? — Well, I am planning to enroll at the university. — Coming back to the system… — Yes. I have my doubts because people are young, professors sometimes are difficult and all that. — I know, I experience that very much myself. Also, office job, no nature, no movement, in front of a screen all day, closed space… You understand why the non-Ph.D. I guess. My body needs to move, I need to dance. For example, I was noticing before that just in this room there are probably more plants that on the whole floor of my university building. I have been reading lately about civilization and we are living in a very badly designed environment. I like to put a kids’ example of five monkeys locked in a jail and hungry for several days without eating. If you threw a banana, we both know what will happen. But if the same five monkeys are free on the jungle, plenty of bananas around, it is likely that they will cooperate so they can get more bananas. It is the same with human beings. You put them in this society, and of course, people get depressed, burn out, loneliness and blablabla. Even, I recently realized how spirituality and positive psychology are being used by the system. — Spirituality, what do you mean? — Yes, you know, all this rhetoric of you can do it yourself if you work enough, believe in your dreams, work hard to get to your goals and all that. I think it is very isolating and against human nature. It makes people sacrifice relationships for working hours. And then spirituality, which is a wonderful tool of self-exploration and introspection, is used to blame people for their own emotions. Ah, if you feel like shit, it is not a problem of you working all day, being locked in a car while you are commuting and not seeing your family. No, it is that you complain too much and that you don’t understand yourself and your emotions. Fuck, no! That is not the problem, it is the problem of the system. — Hmmm. I see. — But yes, what about your university? You will meet some people. At least it won’t be so isolating like a job in front of a screen the whole day… — Yes… But the students at the university, they are a bit too young. Only party and that. It will be a bit weird. — Yes, yes, for me it was the same. I was in Louvain-La-Neuve, so you can imagine… And what are you thinking about studying? — I am doubting between physiotherapy and kinesiology. — Uhhh, that sounds cool. Also, you will mix it with yoga knowledge. — Yep, I would like to combine it for later when I become a yoga teacher. — That is nice. At some point, a friend of hers entered the studio. After greeting each other she introduced me: — This is Carlito… Flurito? — Hahaha, yes! Florito! — He is a super-interesting guy. — Come’ on. I have been here just for 7 minutes and I spent 5 of them standing there looking at my smartphone. — He is going to Africa to do something about psychology and spirituality, and also he dances. I try to maintain myself in order and avoid any type of extra bragging, humble or not. The two friends started to talk to each other, catching up. I checked the phone, answered some messages. Then, while the Greek woman ordered and get ready to close the studio, I briefly talked with the person that had just arrived. She praised my “Truth is non-violent” t-shirt, and I told her that it was the Carlito Fluito merchandising. — I don’t have a job anymore, so…. We left the studio, said goodbye, and reminded them, that I would use Instagram to keep the tack of my journey if they wanted to check. We said goodbye with a hug, and I confirmed my prejudice about how easy and smooth it is to interact with people that are in a “higher level of vibration”, the type of people you are likely to meet in a Yoga Studio. Then, I head home. Send some voice notes to P. and took the “Crushing at the top” picture. 1.2.10 Tearing my soul apart Due to the guy of the package had arrived quite early, while I was about taking a power nap at my place, I was liberated to do the errands that I needed to do before departing Brussels. I was very lucky since the package was picked up at about 10 am, and it was scheduled from 8 am to 8 pm. Thus, I used the momentum to finish up Mortimer’s tale. I wanted to express the image of the cypselae flying, and I rewrite it a couple of times. When I thought it was done, I read the whole thing out loud in the solitude in my room, and I couldn’t contain my tears. I didn’t know where they were coming from, but there they were.17 I looked at the window and I saw the tree and the buildings that I had been watching for two years and a half. An image that I would likely not see again in this life, or at least for a long time. It was sunny, there was the sun, there was life, it was beautiful. A feeling of sadness mixed with liberation and release, together with the admiration of the beauty of being alive; and the imagination of the cypselae floating around the tree in that ephemeral dance; and the shared pain of the dandelion for not wanting to acknowledge the wonderful existence and moment that it had created; and the fact that R. hadn’t come to the goodbye gathering with the flatmates because he probably kept on thinking that I was ungrateful and pathetic for not staying at his place for one week more; and all the suffering I have had during the last month; and all the good moments I have lived in that room; all the things I have learned and how I have grown in that city; to acknowledge that I was closer to my death, but filled with life… It all mixed up in my brain, making me unable of processing anything other than the view of the window on my visual cortex. I was crying and I took the phone almost instantaneously and recorded myself. So deep. So pure, so real, so irrepressible, so inimitable. That is the type of content no one dares to upload to social media, but at the same time, the one voyeurs followers of reality shows seek with such compulsion. There they were; my true, real tears. The ones A. hadn’t gotten. A gift for all of you human beings. For all of you, my people. There they were. Enjoy them. Some words came to my being. Words of truth because “I hear you sing M., I heard you sing”. At some point of enlightenment, people stop talking to start singing. The words just move smoothly, floating and dancing throughout the air, with rhythm, with sonority, with charm, with love. Then, you can trust, those are words of truth, those are words of life. If they ask you whether you are laughing or crying, don’t let know. Don’t let them know, because you don’t know. Don’t let them know. They may ask you why? — Well…, you can answer, I don’t know. I had been cleaning, so I was wearing that girlish purple t-shirt with a purpurin heart in the chest pocket. I couldn’t contain the ridiculousness and spontaneousness irony of the situation. There I was tearing my soul apart, sharing it with an infinite audience, and dressed up in my most unprepared clothes. And still, so real, so true, so genuine. My heart, my heart to you all. Thanks for being. After emailing the tale to S., I head outside home. I had to go to the post office and the city hall. I didn’t have much time to lose. 1.2.11 Waiting for the transport guy I had to spend all morning at home. I woke up at 8 am, just in case, and I walked Mortimer with the feeling that the transport van for taking the package could arrive just at that point. In that case, it was more likely that any of my flatmates would be leaving home for work, and thus speak with the transport guy. I came back with Mortimer. I hadn’t slept much since I had been packing and cleaning until late night. The estimated time was from 8 am to 8 pm. Not the best. I was feeling confused and tired. I wanted to sleep but there was much to do. At the same time, I was feeling unrested since I was always worrying that the guy would appear at any moment and I would miss the doorbell. Thus, I spent most of my time eating and playing with Mortimer. Those were probably our last moments together. I had taken a picture of him and a dandelion during the walk that I would add to the tale I had written the previous day. I was leaving, and I wasn’t sure whether that dog was aware of it or not. He would surely miss me after two years of waiting for me to be walked, feed, or licking my feet. I gave him the love I had had to dose for so long. I massage and pet him, let him play with the ball, and made some runs around the hall of the house. It is an old dog, but he also deserves to have some fun. Luckily enough, when I had decided that I would take a short siesta, the guy of the transport rung. I helped him leaving my packages at the van, and I told him to put them in a flat position instead of vertical. He didn’t care much and I was wishing that all that material stuff would arrive as safe as possible to Spain. 1.2.12 Previous days As everyone’s my story doesn’t finish the morning before leaving, neither the previous night. It doesn’t finish in me leaving my office for the last time or speaking about who of my colleague is going to come to Zambia or the moment I realized I am going to reincarnate in a tree. It doesn’t finish when I wrote Mortimer’s tale. It doesn’t finish with the serious conversation that I had with S., or with my unproductivity on the university even though I had taken the methylphenidate. It doesn’t finish Sunday when I smoked a joint in front of my smartphone and I danced upside-down climbing walls in the middle of the street. It doesn’t finish in any of the stories that are yet to be told. Actually, my story doesn’t even finish in the present moment, while I am writing this line. This moment is the present, current time where the story is right now, and the more we move backward, the more we would advance towards the past, not towards the end of the story, but towards the real beginning. Is it the beginning of my story that dawn of September 1992, when my body left the womb of my mother with a couple of knots from the umbilical cord on my neck due to (or maybe causing) my neuroatypical brain? Does maybe my story begin the moment the lucky spermatozoid of my father reached the egg of my mother? Does maybe my story begin in any of my previous lives? Or does it begin back when the grandfather of my grandfather was surviving to the Spanish Carlists wars? Maybe the day the Arab with my surname, Alcalá, met the Spanish woman that would spread his foreign family name? Or maybe back to the days where the small group of hunter-gathered Sapiens my ancestors used to belong to establish themselves in a city, willingly or unwillingly, and started their contribution to civilization? Maybe when that branch of new world neotenies apes started using language, tools, imagination, and symbolism to cooperate with each other more efficiently? Maybe the day an asteroid hit the planet-killing species that had survived millions of years and changing the biological hierarchy of the ecosystem? Maybe even before when the first legged fishes venture outside of the seas exposing themselves to lethal levels of sun radiation? Or when the cells grouped themselves in primal jellyfishes? Or the first act of love and cooperation known in the biological animal when a prokaryote cell realized that hosting a fellow prokaryote was to his long-term advantage? Maybe the moment huge masses of atoms got attracted to each other forming a floating and flaming rock located at the right distance of a medium-size star at some place of an endless universe? Maybe back on the moments when the universe expanded at the speed of light, cooling off its vibration and increasing its size? Maybe before? Maybe the day S. coined and shared the nickname Carlito Fluito with me during her trip to Belgium in 2014? I don’t know. Much in the fashion of Memento, by Christopher Nolan, this is a tale narrated backwards and forwards simultaneously. I started registering my life more systematically by sharing my mind on letters back in 2013. Since, then, I have collected more than a thousand pages of written thoughts coming from me and from my friends. Considering the length of my letter, I guess that about six or seven hundred pages are entirely written by me. I have many projects to write, many Unfinished books, and time is pressing every single day. I struggle with publishing, editing, formatting, and typesetting. I would love to have a team that would allow me to focus exclusively on the creative process, without getting distracted with practicalities. Till I found it, I will keep doing my best. Forgive my flaws and mistakes, be compassionate, and if you believe in me and my words, help is always welcomed. Just to give last words of conclusion, the lesson I had to learn at this point in my life was letting go. It has become clear to me, especially since the last summer, when I met A.. I surrender my whole self to the universe, lying down next to a devil, and I assumed that I would walk away, leaving aside all those things that weren’t meant for me. I was ready to leave the Erasmus Exchange, to let it go. Later on Estonia, I learn, forget, remember, and obviate that I had to let go of A.. Finally, after months of suffering and, at least, two years of bumping against the same wall, I took the decision that I had to left the Ph.D. and my life in Brussels in order to pursue something else, something more meaningful, something full of love. Writing this letter has been one of these things I was supposed to do. Here it is. The rest, are just stories that would be told at the right moment. Stay tuned, support and spread. Love to you all, my people. Life is happening, the future is coming, and it is going to be wonderful. I can sense it. Trust, believe, and you’ll see. Love to you all, my people. Carlos Alcalá, a.k.a.

Amor, More info further down this letter.↩ For more information, check the previous letter to B.↩ Under working process↩ For more on my love stories check [Unfinished loves] (ADD LINK)↩ Playing with visualizations and altered consciousness states allows to swift between dreaming and awake quite smoothly preserving a fair deal of the events of the dream in the awakened memory.↩ Just a naïve footnote… What percentage of your thoughts are generated by you? I was meditating 10 minutes to take a break form the screen and reaching the end, a voice entered my head. Who am I Carlos? Who am I? I have chosen the path of remaining human. I chose it twice. At the [Vipassana] (ADD LINK), and on my terrace on Leuven, when that distant point of light kept on approaching to me until it become a floating multicolor sphere in front of me. Today, whatever it happened, happened, and it is getting closer and closer. It is coming, my people, it is coming. It is coming fast. It is happening now.↩ I am remembering a dream of few days ago, where A., my original psychopath enters my room and plays games with me. The people of my group (young ones, maybe children) invite her because I told them so. They convince her to enter the room even though she is unwilling to do it. Once inside, we are left alone and I told her that none of us can leave the room until we solve our situation. It feels a bit like a game in a Jigsaw film, a game I just created. We are both locked there, and our brains have to work together to resolve the puzzle of our minds, our lives, our souls. However, she is smarter. She is more powerful than me. She triangulates me with another guy, a Muslim guy (like Oussama at the exchange), and somehow, she is able to leave the room, which transforms into a bus, and the moment she is outside with the guy, about kissing him or something else, the bus starts moving away, and I am feeling like losing because she manipulated me again, she was able to break the rules and go out of the room, while I am forced to leave the place against my will in that bus, passively doing nothing and accepting my situation while she is with another guy. How different the whole story was at the dream of the night with S. …↩ crudi-lazy↩ To not offend my friends and organizers of the goodbye party in Leuven 2014. That one was lovely, very numerous, with a dancing event on the side, and many vegetarian burgers on the barbeque. It also had a lovely ending where V. and me shared that bonbon box that P. brought for me. However, that is a story to be told in another moment. (You may find it in the letters). However, the one in Brussels of two nights ago was next, next level.↩ For those that don’t believe in energies, and consider it as wu-wu, I guess that you undestand the metaphor and use of the word energy in this sentence.↩ If you feel offended, which I hope you don’t, and you want to tell me something privately and directly; I also work as a psychological counselor. You can book an appointment sending me a message on my social media, or an email at carlitofluito@gmail.com. I will use my undivided attention to listen to your problems and life circumstances that you want to share with me, and we can figure out together what may be the next steps that are supposed to be taken into reaching a more fulfilling, lovely, and meaningful life where you are offering humankind all your potentiality. Thanks for your understanding. I learn this by going too often to Place de Luxembourg, and missing writing opportunities at random conversations in bus trips. (Just to point out exceptions, one of the most humbling interactions with a person during last year, was during the summer, when I was seated next to a hacker that knew more than me about virtually any topic during the bus ride from Vienna to Ljiubiana. But that is a Story To Be Told In Another Occasion. S.T.B.T.I.A.O.)↩ Once you realized it, it will be impossible not seeing it the next time you visit one of the most beautiful European squares.↩ S.T.B.T.I.A.M.↩ Nothing against Spain though. Lovely people.↩ One of my classical posts… It’s not that much↩ It is LI: E at Kostas’ kitchen clock. I am writing because I am doing it for myself, if I had to work for something of the university, I would have likely go to sleep. That is the difference between working for yourself and doing it for others. That you can do it at your own tempo. In my case, drinking some Darleejing tea, eating some lentils with rice, and typing in this laptop in Muster at 6I: E. Time flies.↩ A. had asked me if I wanted to cry when I was with her in Estonia, and I had answered that I wasn’t sure. She had asked me when it had been the last time, and I told her that it was during the summer, when I saw the episode of Black Mirror where the protagonist highjacks a worker of a social media company(Smithereens). It is devastating to realize that the episode is dated on 2018 and we are already living in 2020. So far away from our human nature.↩ "]
