<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> 2014-02. Letter to the deaths. - Self-deception</h2>
<p>Hello Tom (1991 - 2007)</p>
<p>Hello Monica (1989 - 2011)</p>
<p>I’m writing to you in a selfish way. Because I need you. I need to write to someone. I need to tell someone what I’m learning . I’m self- deceiving myself, thinking that I’m not taking time out from you, because for you there is nothing left. You have plenty of time now that you’re not here. I’m deceiving myself because I need you. I need to write to you.</p>
<p>I think I’m giving you something, and even dead, I’m taking away from you. I hope you are in peace, and I’m not bothering you with this letter. I need people, I need the lies. Still. I just realise that I am not going to be able to study the Social Networks Master’s Degree next year, since I missed the deadline. It seems even funny to know that I was already dead. I had been dead for a month and I didn’t know it. That I had one of the happiest weeks of my life and my future was dead. That I was living the present, happy. Filled with wellbeing . Helping the world. All of this thanks to my past, thanks to forgetting my past, to emptying my heart, filling my stomach, weakening my ambitions and strengthening my bones. I was happy, infinitely happy. Blooming, productive. In less than a week I went from consuming cannabis to considering seriously not killing animals for my own benefit or consumption.</p>
<p>I abandoned my self, my egoism. I have emptied myself, my morality is now focused on the other. I couldn’t steal if its other’s belongings, I couldn’t steal knowing that somebody needs more than me. I couldn’t breathe if my oxygen would cause someone else’s death. I’ve given in, I’ve emptied myself. But I fill myself. I fill myself often.</p>
<p>Ambitions. I need this letter for working for the world, for them, for those alive. For every person that is still here. I needed to talk to those over there to realise that I have to work for this world. I must share this happiness and wellbeing that I have achieved. To spread and to give. Life is giving, therefore I’m begging to the Death. So that the Death gives to life what it takes from it.</p>
<p>From a cemetery,I’m writing. From a cemetery, I learn. Because the living, with thedead, are still connected. That is why I want to study Social Networks becausekeeping my happiness is selfish because watching suffering calmly is selfish,being willing to change is ambition, but enjoying other’s suffering is egotistic.</p>
<p>And I’m alone, and I’m not alone. Because people exist. Because I cannot change anybody. The change is within each one, and outside, through writing. Talking to the dead and taking from the Death what it takes from us every day. We want It to give our life back. But prayers are selfish, writing is sharing. I’m writing for myself and on behalf of others. Because my letters have a receiver, even if they’re dead. Because it remains written, and any alive person will read it. Because I empty myself giving, and I fill myself back by emptying other people. Because I search for calm, and I give calm. I don’t hold it.</p>
<p>Icreate emptiness in my body, so I can host others within me.</p>
<p>And I don’t ask for anything in return. I don’t ask for anything they aren’t willing to give. I have air, water, food, and people. I have an empty glass to be filled.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> 2014-02-11 From Paloma</h2>
<p>Hello Carlos, how’s it going?</p>
<p>The missing one… I guess you’ve been traveling, haven’t you? Morocco, isn’t it?? Ui, ui, that healthy envy. Surely it has been an experience, tell me things.</p>
<p>I’m going to Bristol this week to see some friends and see if I can disconnect a little. What’s that about you losing your phone? I hope that you solve it soon. You are such a mess!!</p>
<p>Well, how were the exams? I suppose fucking nicely or at least well. You’re probably already handling yourself speaking English very very well, Manuel. Hahahahahaha. And what plans do you have for this quarter??</p>
<p>I’ve finished the exams and I did nice although I haven’t yet been given the psychosocial mark. They’re so slow. And nothing… All subjects pass and that. Although I am aiming for more. Now starting the next quarter and I think that the party is gonna be over… Many assignments and many classes to which I have to go necessarily. In fact, right now, I am in “Psychology of personality”, and it seems to me that participation and ass-kissing count more than anything else. Hahaha. I also wanted to ask you for an opinion on how to work on the subjects and all that, and which are themost interesting and so on. But well, you will tell me if you remember. I have: personality, critical thinking, health, linguistic and cognitive development, and psychological evaluation. When you can and feel like it, you tell me what you want. I relied too much on your advice that has always been good for me.</p>
<p>Regarding my life, not so much novelty: living in Salamanca and disconnected a little bit from my life from before, honestly… I want to do new thingsssss!!!! So that’s what I tell youuu. I hope you enjoy the quarter and we talk soon, ok? Be happy!!</p>
<p>A huge kiss, freak!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> 2014-02-11 To Paloma</h2>
<p>Hello Paloma,</p>
<p>I’m all very well. I arrived yesterday from Morocco. A fantastic experience. I’m writing a chronicle of the trip, so when I finish it I will send it to you so that you give me your opinion before posting it on the blog.</p>
<p>When you travel, open your eyes, talk to people, ask them the most basic and absurd thing you can think of. The world is full of nuances to taste. Leave your phone in airplane mode during the day. Enjoy the moment. Others can wait for a while for them to know how you’re doing. Take pictures of everything that deserves a photo. Good pictures, you know how to take them. But leave the best moments for your memory. Don’t photograph those.</p>
<p>The stars of the Sahara sky cannot be photographed with the smartphone. The sunset on the mountainous horizon while I was meditating/praying on a dune, can’t be photographed either. I got goosebumps every time I think about it.</p>
<p>If you really want to disconnect, don’t worry about others. Your time is yours. You can tell them you’re going to be out there and when you get back, you’ll let them know.</p>
<p>The cell phone has appeared. It’s at Charleroi Airport. It’s 20€ transport to go back and forth. So, I will see if I can find someone who can pick it up for me. It makes me think it showed up. I think a lot about how I have behaves in the past with the goods that didn’t belong to me. I need time to think about that…</p>
<p>My grades are given to me on the 13th of February. Everything went pretty good. I’ll tell you when I know numerically. English works in ups and downs, oscillating.</p>
<p>Plans for the quarter: too many. But at least I’m getting used to not using the computer/smartphone, writing by hand and sleeping less than six hours. We will see what are the results…</p>
<p>Don’t use your smartphone/computer when you’re in class. Look at the professor’s face. They will have already explained to you how important feedback is at this point. Live in the moment. Technology is a tool, not a part of you. You don’t go with a hammer to class and you start hitting the table. Even if you can. Every tool has its moment. Control the tool so the tool won’t control you. Look with your eyes and think with your brain. Write with your hands.</p>
<p>About the subjects of this quarter.</p>
<p>Personality. I got a distinction with honors. It’s true it’s about “ass-kissing”. Interest, curiosity, participation are prettier words, though. Palenzuela is a pretty active, nocturnal person, like me. We got and get along pretty well. He’s not the best teacher, he gets messy with the ideas quite often. But it makes you think twice as much, so you can build on your own what he means. Take it as a challenge, not as a threat.</p>
<p>Critical thinking. I did almost every assignment with an incredibly hard-working girl. She did most of them. Read the book and take it as a guide. It’s all there. Silvia was my teacher. Very friendly, nice and accessible. We got along very well.</p>
<p>Health. Góngora also gets messy by himself. Sometimes he explains things in one practice group that he doesn’t explain in another. Compare your notes with people from other groups and take lots of notes in the theoretical class. He knows a lot. If you’re interested, ask questions. However, well, it’s clinical psychology, and it wasn’t my favorite subject.</p>
<p>Evaluation. If Cristina Genaro is your teacher, go to class and copy everything she says. Looks like a dictation. It’s kind of ridiculous for a university class, but it’s what he asks on the exam. Go to the practice class. If it Genaro is not your teacher, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Cognitive development. Read the articles before you go to class. Go to the library one afternoon, no phone or computer. Take a couple of hours to read it. You’re going to make the most of the class and save time in May. The work is long and tiresome. Try to anticipate and get it done with time. It’s pretty methodical, so you don’t have to think too much, but you have to work a lot. It takes time.</p>
<p>Live the present, Paloma. Quit technology and meet people. You don’t tell everyone everything you do. Write something for yourself. Handwrite. Do things one at a time. Focus on what you’re doing and forget problems you can’t fix right now. Note them up so you won’t forget about them and you’ll fix them in the future. Learn and let yourself be influenced. Don’t prejudge, as much as it is possible. You’re smart enough to make your decisions on your own. But if you need help, ask for it. Always.</p>
<p>We’re in touch, Paloma.</p>
<p>I also attach to you the work I did in Personality. It’s two pages. Palenzuela quite liked it, so you can trust it to be fine. But he’ll remember, so don’t copy it. I hope it will guide you. Don’t get stuck with the writing question. Read it slowly, and if you don’t understand something it’s normal. You haven’t studied it yet. I think the terms “personality process” and “personality in action” are reversed. That’s what he corrected when I gave it to him. Personality in action is the operation of the personality in process and the personality state is the result of the personality process. Don’t trust me too much, wait for May. When you read it again everything will make more sense and you can correct my work.</p>
<p>A kiss,</p>
<p>Carlos.</p>
