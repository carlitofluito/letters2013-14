<h2>2014-03-31 To Al.</h2>
<p>2014-03-31</p>
<p>Hello Al.</p>
<p>First of all, I thank you and congratulate you on the fact that you have written to me. It is interesting to note that most people, at least in our country / continent, have received enough education to think and write for themselves. Therefore, external figures are often unnecessary. These external figures that in our day to day are continually telling us what we have to like, what we have to say and what we have to think. Independently and personally, we can develop our own arguments and ideas. In order to carry out this process, I consider, specifically, an essential tool: <em>writing</em>. Writing implies some reflection. Therefore, referring to the writing process, we are pointing to the need for individual reflection. Today, the time for reflection and writing has disappeared. I consider that this time is being stolen, second by second, and minute by minute by instant communication technologies, smart phones, and the Internet.</p>
<p>I have been working on these ideas for several weeks. I would like to be able to develop them properly and explain them, to be understood by a greater number of people. I am also aware that I need some empirical and argumentative support for what I want to defend, and in many occasions, I do not have so easy access to the knowledge and different sources. Right now, personally to you, pointing out the value one person is placing on the other one by writing a letter or by having a conversation. This person is dedicating his time, his life. But the attention, the interest and the depth of the relationship fall down when one is continuously interrupting the conversation by checking WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter. Also, if you get to break the habit of immediate communication, you enjoy more the interpersonal relationship, you get more individual freedom, and an important part of our worries and anxieties is reduced, since it is impossible to intervene instantly in a situation where one is not physical present. But above all, time is saved. On an individual level, and as a personal case, saying that since I live far from instant communication, I have more time for myself, and for my friends.</p>
<p>During my period of technological disconnection, I made quite a few decisions. Some of them quite complicated. One of the most difficult was assuming that I must sacrifice certain areas of knowledge, of the world in which I live, and of my social life. Areas and aspects of my life that really interest me. Two of these aspects in which I decided that I did not have time to go deeper were political, national and international politics; and the arts. It was painful, but I had to admit that time is limited, and I cannot go into everything. For this reason, the problem of national politics; specifically, the Canarian regional policy; that you refer, was completely unknown to me, until you communicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give a man a fish and you will feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you will feed him a lifetime. "</p>
<p>Chinese proverb<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it serves as justification, I’d say that I cannot be fishing all my life. But I can try to get other people to start fishing. In this way, I could eat their fish, and they could eat from mine. I am sure that most people want and can delve into some aspect and areas of knowledge or the world. If they explain their vision, this saves time when searching for and obtaining the information. Having certain moral criteria and delivery by others, we can control that the product has a certain quality and reliability.</p>
<p>Next, I’d like to briefly develop an idea that has been going through my head for quite some time. It is the idea about the hopelessness of the Spanish people. As you had read, or you can read on <a href="https://excusasparanovolver.blogspot.com/2014/01/handwritten-eso-es-lo-importante.html">my blog</a>, my purpose is for the Spanish people to wake up. Let’s stop talking, drink coffee, and let’s have hope again, trying to solve things. Let’s reflect, and above all, write.</p>
<p>Talking and having conversations about the current bad or good situation is a motivating or demotivating activity. Sometimes very beautiful, others not so much. Sometimes invigorating, and sometimes strenuous. But, commonly, is not productive. Talking doesn’t usually change things excessively. Do the words are gone with the wind… I speak to you without references and from memory, so don’t believe everything I tell you. A friend told me one day that the fact of sharing your purposes before carrying them out inhibits the achievement of those goals. The argumentation was as follows: goals, simply by having told them and by the mere fact of talking about them, makes the individual believe that they have already been acomplished. Obviously I need a reference to these kinds of statements, but for what interests us now, let’s assume that this is true.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>From my point of view, I consider that one of the great problems facing the Spanish people is despair. Assuming what is stated above to be correct, this hopelessness could be originated in the search, sometimes successful, for solutions and alternatives to current problems, through the spoken word, and not the written one. It is common to hear that much is said, and little is done. The individual may think that by speaking, every possible effort has already been made, and that the alternatives have been exhausted. But, unluckily, nothing has changed. So, the Spanish with a revolutionary and hopeful conversation in the café returns home defeated, probably to check Facebook or to continue complaining about the topic on WhatsApp, observing that their words do not have the impact they deserve in society. With which, hopelessness and inactivity are a by-product that will soon appear.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I consider that what makes a crucial difference is the manifestation of thought in written form, rather than in spoken form. When the main objective of ideas and thoughts is the impact on society and the change in the thinking of other individuals, writing is presented as the most appropriate means to manifest thought. Both for the person who issues them and for the person who receives them, this mean of expression carries a series of intrinsic characteristics that enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. At the writer’s level, the ordered and argued expression of ideas helps to build and solidify one’s own thinking. Furthermore, their reach in the population is incomparable. There are no longer any spatial or temporal limits in the scope of the writer’s thought, since writing immortalizes and perpetuates the author’s point of view. At the level of the receiver of these ideas, when expressed in writing, the reader has complete freedom to delve into them, not restricting their study to the time or situation where these ideas were first issued. Being able to carry out a detailed analysis of the argumentation, looking for its affinities or its disparities with the author. Without any reference, and with an almost complete lack of knowledge, I maintain that one of the key aspects during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a> was the quantity and quality of writers and intellectuals, who shaped the thoughts and ideas that the people wanted to express. I invite any curious reader to develop and argue my idea, if time requires; because the tools are within everyone’s reach: research, reading, reflection, and writing.</p>
<p>This little argument and hypothesis serve to reaffirm that “<em>The pen is mightier than the sword</em>” (Edward Bulwer Lytton); and that battles are won with ideas, and not with pitchforks.</p>
<p>Due to the number of ideas that are born and die on the <a href="https://reflexiona-handwritten.blogspot.com/2014/04/cafes-desesperanzadores.html">coffee tables</a>, which have little impact on society, it is normal for people to live hopeless. The radical problem is that these ideas; many of them, potential solutions; don’t reach the population they should. Sometimes to the originators of the problems, and sometimes to those affected by them. That is why I write this text and that is why I want you to write. So that your ideas, yours, the one you have, do not die on the coffee tables, so that they are registered in a document that can be read by more people than could hear a conversation between you and me.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not agree with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repsol#Canary_Islands">Repsol’s performance on the Canary Islands</a>, write about it. Mobilize yourself and mobilize your environment. But this time, try to do it in a more intellectual way. Writing.</p>
<p>I would not like that what I am going to present next be misinterpreted and supposed that I am against the demonstrations, or that writting something about the problem that concerns a given demonstration is a necessary condition to attend this one; but I would like my argumentation to be read, from the most objective point of view possible.</p>
<p>With new technologies, everything goes more (superficially) fast. A demonstration can be organized within few hours through Twitter. But it will be a superficial, empty manifestation. I begin to understand that they do not take us into account. We try to build the house from the roof. On many occasions, the demonstrations are full of people who cannot present their arguments in a clear and orderly way, because they have not worked on them. They have not read them; they have not reflected on them, and they have not written them. For this reason, I am not too fond of demonstrations. I don’t believe in them too much. On the other hand, I am a believer in social pressure and direct action, manifested through a mass sending of protest letters or properly argued political blogs. After this period of reflection and writing, the moment of the citizen demonstration would come. With a people made up of intellectual and educated citizens; which, difficult to deceive; the value of the demonstrations will increase exponentially, since they will be signs of protest and rejection, coming from a people who are aware of their rights and based on properly constructed arguments. The components of these manifestations would be intellectually prepared to sustain their ideas, to sustain a quality argument. These citizens would compose a reflective, writing, and active people. They would have overcome the population of the tables of the despair coffees, to become a people capable of change.</p>
<p>Still, the creation of such a town involves certain sacrifices. Some of these sacrifices could be the substitution of relationships based on WhatsApp conversations for relationships based on letters, where the depth and construction of the relationship is prioritized above the selfishness of the message and the obtaining of instant feedback; or the sacrifice of minutes on Facebook in exchange of writing a blog post, in which each citizen finds why to fight for and he or she finds how to do it.</p>
<p>(You have just been my inspiring muse …) After this little political rally, which I had wanted to write for a long time, which I will publish on the blog in the future, I am able to continue answering your letter.</p>
<p>Álvaro, as you correctly detect, I think that your possible lack of success in romantic relationships (I don’t like to call it lack of success, it sounds fatal, but it is useful right now), is due to a problem of self-acceptance. To give love, you have to love yourself first.</p>

<p>All past relationships, whatever the outcome, have served you for learning. So that you are here today, reading this letter. Therefore, as long as there is learning, there is no failure. Don’t blame yourself for your past, because it was necessary for you to learn to love yourself. It is a whole process towards yourself. For some people it is longer and for others it is shorter. Do not worry. Human beings are different. What I personally believe, as you may have already noticed, is that <em>writing</em> helps. It helps a lot. Writing helps structure your thinking, as you have already read. In addition, it helps you to position yourself, to know where you come from and where you want to go. I am pretty sure that many of your doubts will be solved by writing and reflecting on what you really need and what you want to do with your life.</p>
<p>Another important detail that helps is <em>people</em>, the others, your friends. That is why, in a very functional way, and killing two birds with one stone<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>; I asked you to write to me, and I also suggested that you write to P. To help her, to help you, and for her to help you. I don’t know anything about boys, nor about affective relationships, so I can’t advise you anything. I hope that once you’ve solved your own personal problems, and accepted yourself as you are, completely, many of your problems in your emotional and social relationships can be solved by yourself.</p>
<p>Also recommend you the reading of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching"><em>Tao Te King</em></a>, which, personally, is helping me a lot to discover myself. To empty myself. About your supposed superficiality, I refer to what was previously exposed. Once you discover yourself and get to know yourself inside, you will realize that you are a person full of an infinity of things, sometimes too many things. Then, you will feel the need to empty yourself, (read the <em>Tao</em> to understand it better). From then on, when someone tells you that you are empty, you will take it as a compliment rather than an insult. Also, probably, you will feel sorry for the other person’s ignorance, because having discovered yourself deeply, you will see that emptiness is your objective and that you are quite far from achieving it.</p>
<p>For closing, telling you that I appreciate when you write letters to me, but understand that answering takes time, and I haven’t had much lately. Even living without technology. So, you must be patient. Still, I invite you to spread my ideas, if you want to share them, about writing letters and delving into yourself through writing. I hope that you write to more people and that they answer you, because at the same time that you deepen into yourself, you will be helping other people deepening into themselves. You can also write a blog about the reality of the Canary Islands, for all people, who, like me, do not check the news, because, although they have been said and repeated a thousand times, not everyone has heard them.</p>
<p>I, Álvaro, am fine, tranquil. We will have time to catch up.</p>
<p>A strong hug,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
<p>Leuven, March 26, 2014</p>
<p>P.S. I hope the wait was worth it.</p>
