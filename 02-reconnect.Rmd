## 2014-02-11 From P. {-#frompaloma20140211}

Hello Carlos, how's it going? 

The missing one... I guess you've been traveling, haven't you? Morocco, isn’t it?? Ui, ui, that healthy envy. Surely it has been an experience, tell me things. 

I'm going to Bristol this week to see some friends and see if I can disconnect a little. What's that about you losing your phone? I hope that you solve it soon. You are such a mess!!

Well, how were the exams? I suppose fucking nicely or at least well. You're probably already handling yourself speaking English very very well, Manuel. Hahahahahaha. And what plans do you have for this quarter?? 

I've finished the exams and I did nice although I haven't yet been given the psychosocial mark. They're so slow. And nothing… All subjects pass and that. Although I am aiming for more. Now starting the next quarter and I think that the party is gonna be over… Many assignments and many classes to which I have to go necessarily. In fact, right now, I am in "*Psychology of personality*", and it seems to me that participation and ass-kissing count more than anything else. Hahaha. I also wanted to ask you for an opinion on how to work on the subjects and all that, and which are themost interesting and so on. But well, you will tell me if you remember. I have: personality, critical thinking, health, linguistic and cognitive development, and psychological evaluation. When you can and feel like it, you tell me what you want. I relied too much on your advice that has always been good for me.

Regarding my life, not so much novelty: living in Salamanca and disconnected a little bit from my life from before, honestly... I want to do new thingsssss!!!! So that's what I tell youuu. I hope you enjoy the quarter and we talk soon, ok? Be happy!!

A huge kiss, freak!

Hello P.,
 
I'm all very well. I arrived yesterday from Morocco. A fantastic experience. I'm writing a chronicle of the trip, so when I finish it I will send it to you so that you give me your opinion before posting it on the blog. 
 
When you travel, open your eyes, talk to people, ask them the most basic and absurd thing you can think of. The world is full of nuances to taste. Leave your phone in airplane mode during the day. Enjoy the moment. Others can wait for a while for them to know how you're doing. Take pictures of everything that deserves a photo. Good pictures, you know how to take them. But leave the best moments for your memory. Don’t photograph those.
 
The stars of the Sahara sky cannot be photographed with the smartphone. The sunset on the mountainous horizon while I was meditating/praying on a dune, can't be photographed either. I got goosebumps every time I think about it.
 
If you really want to disconnect, don't worry about others. Your time is yours. You can tell them you're going to be out there and when you get back, you'll let them know.
 
The cell phone has appeared. It's at Charleroi Airport. It's 20€ transport to go back and forth. So, I will see if I can find someone who can pick it up for me. It makes me think it showed up. I think a lot about how I have behaves in the past with the goods that didn't belong to me. I need time to think about that...
 
My grades are given to me on the 13th of February. Everything went pretty good. I'll tell you when I know numerically. English works in ups and downs, oscillating.
 
Plans for the quarter: too many. But at least I'm getting used to not using the computer/smartphone, writing by hand and sleeping less than six hours. We will see what are the results...
 
Don't use your smartphone/computer when you're in class. Look at the professor's face. They will have already explained to you how important feedback is at this point. Live in the moment. Technology is a tool, not a part of you. You don't go with a hammer to class and you start hitting the table. Even if you can. Every tool has its moment. Control the tool so the tool won't control you. Look with your eyes and think with your brain. Write with your hands.
 
About the subjects of this quarter.
 
Personality. I got a distinction with honors. It's true it's about "ass-kissing". Interest, curiosity, participation are prettier words, though. Palenzuela is a pretty active, nocturnal person, like me.  We got and get along pretty well. He's not the best teacher, he gets messy with the ideas quite often. But it makes you think twice as much, so you can build on your own what he means. Take it as a challenge, not as a threat.
 
Critical thinking. I did almost every assignment with an incredibly hard-working girl. She did most of them. Read the book and take it as a guide. It's all there. Silvia was my teacher. Very friendly, nice and accessible. We got along very well.
 
Health. G. also gets messy by himself. Sometimes he explains things in one practice group that he doesn't explain in another. Compare your notes with people from other groups and take lots of notes in the theoretical class. He knows a lot. If you're interested, ask questions. However, well, it's clinical psychology, and it wasn't my favorite subject.
 
Evaluation. If C. G. is your teacher, go to class and copy everything she says. Looks like a dictation. It's kind of ridiculous for a university class, but it's what he asks on the exam. Go to the practice class. If it Genaro is not your teacher, I have no idea.
 
Cognitive development. Read the articles before you go to class. Go to the library one afternoon, no phone or computer. Take a couple of hours to read it. You're going to make the most of the class and save time in May. The work is long and tiresome. Try to anticipate and get it done with time. It's pretty methodical, so you don't have to think too much, but you have to work a lot. It takes time.
 
Live the present, P.. Quit technology and meet people. You don't tell everyone everything you do. Write something for yourself. Handwrite. Do things one at a time. Focus on what you're doing and forget problems you can't fix right now. Note them up so you won't forget about them and you'll fix them in the future.  Learn and let yourself be influenced. Don't prejudge, as much as it is possible. You're smart enough to make your decisions on your own. But if you need help, ask for it. Always.
 
We're in touch, P..
 
I also attach to you the work I did in Personality. It's two pages. Pa. quite liked it, so you can trust it to be fine. But he'll remember, so don't copy it. I hope it will guide you. Don't get stuck with the writing question. Read it slowly, and if you don't understand something it's normal. You haven't studied it yet. I think the terms “personality process” and “personality in action” are reversed. That's what he corrected when I gave it to him. Personality in action is the operation of the personality in process and the personality state is the result of the personality process. Don't trust me too much, wait for May. When you read it again everything will make more sense and you can correct my work.
 
A kiss,
 
Carlos.


## 2014-02-17 To T. {-#tot20140217}

Hello T.
 
Today I feel a little tired, I suppose it is because it is already night, my throat hurts and I am considering taking some caffeine or going to rest.
 
I am writing to you briefly to tell you about my “successful” completion of the first semester as an Erasmus. At least academically. All passed.
 
In general, I am in quite a good mood and I have taken this past week to organize my schedule and prioritize my projects. Re-adapting to student life after my trip to Morocco. (There is a chronicle of the journey in hand; hands paralyzed unfortunately ...)^[6 years of paralysis already.] Still, I think I want to do too much and often go overwhelmed. I plan to write down a motivating message about the difference between moments of inspiration and day-to-day work. Maybe it will work. I'm not sure how to carry out everything I want. I have a schedule with almost no breaks, it is somewhat unreal… In moments of euphoria I write down my ideas and fit them into non-existent hours throughout the week.

I would also like to write more (I have noted down to write at least once a day, either reflectively or communicatively, like right now). With the subject of writing many times it is the first impulse to start writing what I lack. If you have any advice on how to remedy that primordial spark, I would really appreciate it.
 
Anyway, let's stop egocentric banalities. I would like to know about you, your family and your projects.
 
I hope everything is going well.
 
An affectionate hug and thanks for your time.
 
Carlos

Hi L.,
 
The phone just went off and I wanted to continue talking to you. For this reason, I am writing (by hand, obviously).
 
The first thing that came to mind was the verses you just read. That is why they are the first written thing, it is a reliable and chronological representation of the handwritten sheet of paper.
 
At the time the phone was turned off, I was close to feeling anxiety and concern that I could not continue talking to you. But now I'm doing it. I feel like I'm communicating with you. I feel better. I have simply had to overcome the first instinct of inactivity or search for technological contact with you. I have started writing.
 
Even if I am writing this letter at night, you may read it tomorrow, in a week, or in a month. When I want to send it to you, if I send it to you. You may reread it in years and each time it will be different for you. You will be able to read this letter if I die before you and it will appear that I am speaking to you. (This is how I just beat death. This letter is my song ... (Tweet in English. Food for thought, isn’t it?))

This is what technology has demolished. Haste has wiped out patience. The wait, the tasting of the moment, the pleasure of the non-immediate ... The enjoyment of one's own personality, of internal communication. Ultimately, life itself.
 
I don't want to continue writing, so you start doing it. But this little letter/reflection is clear proof of the benefits of writing and the harmfulness of digitized communication. In a few lines and almost without arguments.
 
Now, I start reading. I'm much more relaxed than I was five minutes ago when the phone went off. Also, writing this seems much more real to me than sending you a WhatsApp : “* I'm fine*”. Although it will take days, hours or years to send it to you, or you to read it, for me it has been much more immediate than a WhatsApp.
 
Good night.
 
A huge hug.

P.S. You know I would like to hear from you. (General and extremely open question that you can answer with the degree of detail and specificity that you want). If you want to just write to me that you are fine, I will believe it and continue my life placidly. Taking advantage of my time knowing that L. is happy. Lying to me is lying to yourself.


## 2014-02-21 To S. {-#tos20140221}

2014-02-21

S.,
 
Patience is a really beautiful virtue that gets corrupted by the abuses of technology. Sincerity is the delicious fruit of patience.
 
You asked me a few weeks ago how I was doing, and I replied that at that time I did not have time to respond adequately, that I would write to you in the future. That future is today. I consider that it is a good moment to tell you a little about how I am.
 
I couldn't answer you when you asked me because I didn't have enough time. Also, I was not comfortable answering you in a hurry and without the care and detail that you deserve, and I deserve. I hope it hasn’t arrived bad and that you understand it. I like to take care of communication. I am willing to sacrifice speed for quality. So, I hope your answer, if any, is not hasty. Make it honest, of high-quality. I don't care how long it takes you to write to me, it can be two days, or it can be two years. I'll be fine.
 
In these moments I am very happy. I am very comfortable with my life. I am flourishing, I am incredibly productive. As I never have been. I am learning a lot: I read, I write, I meet incredible people, who show me new horizons and expand my mind; I tear down walls of the past; I understand part of the numerous mistakes I made in the past. But I don't blame myself. Those mistakes are part of my life, of my learning, of being where I am today. I needed to make a mistake to get where I got to. Sometimes it was necessary to be wrong once, but other times it was necessary to be wrong again and again. Enough times until I learned. Many of my mistakes have revolved around you. It had to be this way to learn. If they happen again, it will be equally necessary. It will be proof that I have not yet learned what I have to learn, that I have to continue learning.

Now I am understanding countless things that were incomprehensible to me in the past. That, at times, I acted in a completely illogical, extremely passionate way. Many times, in a hurry and worried about the ephemerality of the moment.
 
Now I'm calm. Much calmer.

In these moments of inner calm, few external storms can stir my spirit.
 
S., I would like to hear from you. You are a person whom, I feel, I have not treated as you deserve. I can learn a lot from you, and I have a feeling that we could have an incredibly fruitful relationship for both of us. No matter the physical distance, as long as there is a spiritual, intellectual, and / or emotional union. The power of the non-physical knows no limits in time or space. (Imagine reading this letter and that I am dead. You could still answer it and be communicating with me.)
 
Out of respect; towards me, but much more important, out of respect for you; I hope you will give me a thought worthy of your ability. If you lie to me, you are lying to yourself. I wrote a couple of days ago to a friend, who told me to that she was "*fine*". Personally, I highly doubt it. So, if that is not true, there is nothing I can do as a friend to help her. But, much more damaging, for both of them, I will believe that there is nothing wrong in not helping her. Lying to me is lying to yourself.
 
 
I would like you to answer me, please. Slowly and sincerely. If you do not want to answer me, I perfectly respect your decision.
 
Carlos

## 2014-02-22 From T. {-#fromT20140222}

2014-02-22

Carlos, good morning.

Congratulations!! For that first term that you have passed as a good Erasmus, not as some have led us to believe that you were, Erasmus students ... Not even Flemish has been a problem, from what I see, which means that you have jumped into the pool since the first day, without fear of the waters and their turbulence.

Do not think I have many things to tell that you do not know or suppose. These last days, and I am going to continue like this until the writing of the paper is finished, I have dedicated the whole time to [Leibniz]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) or, more specifically, to deepen the [conception of the will of God]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e) in Leibniz and in the government of the world. There I am, rummaging, with the magnifying glass on - and even the microscope -, alone with his texts, basting ideas and asking questions. I have gone from having things half clear to clarify myself conceptually, but to see how doubts grow in me about Leibniz himself and his philosophical environments. Right now, although I think I will not raise it in the congress - perhaps I can only point something - I have more and more doubts about the concept of God in Leibniz and in modern philosophy and, through them, about metaphysics, to which I still consider it a fundamental discipline, but whose content depends excessively on the medieval tradition. I leave it there, because you cannot walk with hypotheses and doubts.

Your lack of time - and everyone's - is typical of our time and I am afraid it has been the fate of all the intellectuals who have populated the earth. In any case, in this time of weak, mercantile thought, lost amidst the superficiality of appearance, of manipulations everywhere, of manipulative and adolescent media, of *palabreros, truhanes, mercachifles*, in short, cynics; at this time, to the obligations and commitments of studies and knowledge, we usually combine the time-eater media, which dilute our time, the ability to think, manipulate us and even shape our moral conscience. In the face of all this - the liquid society that [Bauman]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman) talks about - one must select a great deal and be faithful to the schedules that one has drawn up. [@bauman2013liquid] Liquid society liquidates... In other words, when you set timetables and follow them, you are on the right track. We usually fall, I have been, and I am a victim of this, in the temptation to peck at everything, which in the end leads us to delve little or nothing into almost nothing. If it works for you, you who are young can avoid the defects into which many have fallen.

There I continue with the essay reading workshop and forcibly committed to the Parkinson's association, which is taking me much longer than I thought and wanted. At the moment, I have written the contents of the new website, which are mainly medical content, I have already visited a good number of official offices begging, as they say. You go into offices that have plenty of luxury to ask for something that is fair and whose responsibility is the administration, because those affected by Parkinson's have to finance their therapies themselves, since Social Security washes their hands with them. But these sick people are there, with a degenerative disease that lacks a cure. Very strong, but real. They even have the association in some premises, an apartment on a ground floor, which some nuns have left for them. We are fighting there. Let's see what we get. Look! The association is thirteen years old. I have my brother-in-law affected by Parkinson's, who has had to take the presidency of the association, because they had led it to bankruptcy due to mismanagement and the malfunction - I am going to leave it only there - of some worker, especially the psychologist, who until now have not dared to put her on the street, as I think they should. As you see, I walk everywhere, but not as God but lost in what unknown worlds...

Well, Carlos, you do your thing. Learn in someone else's head, in the head of those who, like me, lose themselves by multidisciplinarity - how good I am with myself! - and do not just "squeeze", as the saying goes, in nothing. It is very important to delimit the territory well, since it will be life - the circumstances, [Ortega]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset) would say – who will invite and even force you to dispersion.

I'm going to see if I practice a bit in the kitchen now ... and surprise the family with something, although I don't know with what ...

Health, peace and happiness.

T.

2014-02-24

Hello La.,
 
I know you live in Leuven and I know face-to-face, oral communication, it's invaluable. Still, I wish we could write to each other quite frequently. Of course, the social and emotional nature of our relationship will be maintained face-to-face but debating more purely intellectual content with you in writing can be very fruitful for both of us. I think it will be useful to clarify some of the ideas that we have put forward in recent days.
 
There is a possibility that you may not have time to write. I understand that writing is patience and not rush, so I don't mind if your response is delayed if the quality deserves it. New technologies are in a hurry. Haste produces mistakes and stumbles. With what, ironically, in the long term, cause waste of time. On the other hand, I consider that by using writing continuously, cognitive processes are streamlined, and time ends up being gained.
 
For this reason, I sincerely ask you to dedicate a part of your day and your time to disconnect the distant-communication devices of your room, mainly mobile phone and computer. Then, you can write without interruption and concentration, by hand and from memory. Without data or unnecessary references at the time of the original creation of written thought.
 
The first question I would like to ask you is (assuming your extensive knowledge of, among other things, linguistics) whether you could expose to me the most important differences between the written word and the spoken one. In order not to overflow us with the size of such a question, which I suppose has originated countless books throughout history, I ask that you please do not exceed 2 or 3 pages. For you and for me. Try to condense everything that reflection allows you. To encourage your intrinsic motivation, you can take it as a great summary of everything you have learned so far related to this topic.
 
I hope to receive your reply soon.
 
A warm (and not intellectual) hug,
 
Carlos
 
P.S. If you want, you can take the opportunity to correct grammar, spelling and punctuation errors, among others.

2014-02-24

Good morning, good afternoon or good night.

Today I start writing without knowing the day I will finish. I want to emphasize that, at this very moment, the time I am using to write this letter should be used for other priority reasons. However, today I feel like thinking and writing.

I think the time here is consumed vertiginously, which makes me dread. The embarrassment unnerves and weakens me. I need to plant time and thus collect hours with fruits. Incurring in relatively “absurd time-killers” may not be a good option, given that I regret my limited time. I want to achieve a greater deepening and internalization of the university contents to acquire.

I admit that the commitment that I have guaranteed in the scout group in which I have signed up, is not in accordance with my real "free" time, which dissipates or evaporates an excessively necessary time. I may not be mature enough to deny proposals (both from friends and the group). Maybe I shouldn't be securing projects that I can't commit to.

The other day they called me something between "hypocritical and false" at the same time for this very reason. I don't have the capacity to deny a purpose that they make me. It seems like wanting to give 100, without sometimes being able to reach 50. This is how I end up doing it: badly, in a hurry and running. Still, I step back, stop, and think. Organization is the solution, or maybe the first remedy is to learn to say no?

You who seem to know me, tell me what you consider. Today, I let you be what you like to be.

Greetings Dr. Alcalá,


## 2014-02-24 From L. to herself {-#fromL20140224}

2014-02-24

01/22/2014

Dear future ME:

Who would know about my today self in my past and how funny period I have put her through. The past me has not had a good period years ago, but this year, the proposed objectives have been set. Maybe I wouldn’t have thought I'd get here, but hey, you did it!

You study dance, your life is dance. Today is not too late to improve and train yourself. You can become better than you were yesterday. (And so much compared to your younger years.) I should scold you for too much letting yourself go in your crazy adolescence, since today I regret such a time. However, one writer told me not to be afraid of being the person I have become. That one should not be discouraged by the wrong decisions one made. I must trust my old self. Maybe my thirteen-year-old self could have been mistaken for not studying enough or for being too carried away with that high school boy. But it was I who made the decisions and surely spent some time making them.

Why do you think you now have the right to judge what she (your old self) decided? Accept who you are, don't be afraid to be the person you have become with your decisions. Bad decisions weather, bad decisions, in time, will be good decisions. Accept that and you will be very happy in life and, above all, with yourself. About 80%, you are a consequence of your decisions. Love yourself for the result of what you are. Love yourself because that is what you have become. And above all, recognize that sometimes you are wrong. And that 20% of mistakes, you have to recognize and accept them. It is important that we recognize that we are wrong in order to become aware of where the errors are and not make them anymore. Perhaps many are afraid of the punishment that this can entail, but the punishment is the least of it, the only important thing is to give our brains the correct items.

Maybe without those years, you would not be what you are today.

However, look at where you have arrived. University? At what point did it cross your mind the idea of not-trying it?

Remind you of our family, you should spend more time with them. They have given you everything, today give for them. Love them more, show them more. You are their fruit, do not regret it. (Although I must add that it would be good if you boost trust and interact with them, I consider it essential for your good communication.)

I think that the greatest significance that there has been in my history has been thanks to friendships that I have been collecting over time. (Someday I will write to them). Most are old ones, from always, many others were passing by and wanted to stay awhile. They are surreal stories, but they are the ones that are recorded in mind and skin. They are part of your past, present and expected future self. They are the base, your bases and your being. They complement you. Who would you be if not? You collect bits and form yourself; but not only with them. Today they have marked you and you are what you are for them.

I think you should also be grateful every day for the tortilla turns that they gave you one summer, maybe you weren't here today if it weren’t for those.

Keep all your memoirs, memories and moments. Today you are, because you were yesterday. 

Value yourself, love yourself. They already do, now only you are left. I am already working on it.

Tomorrow, I hope this makes you think, and you like it. Until then, I look forward to great achievements. I think your time has come to take advantage of the untapped. And what the hell, you're in Madrid! Thousands of affairs, to a metro subscription. You know, your time has come. I hope you have gone as far as I want today, and if you have gone further, the better.

LOVES YOU,

Your previous self

Hello mother,

You have worked for a fairly long time of your life, and now you have free time and money. With what you have right now, you have the necessary factors to go on a trip. Having a child abroad, you have the perfect excuse to spend some time in Belgium.

Come to Leuven to spend a few days with me, mother. I am in a moment in which I spread peace, happiness and calm around me. A few days here may be perfect for you. We both know that you love to travel, see the world, learn and have new experiences. I think I can guarantee that your time here will not be wasted. The only objective I have with your visit is to learn and that you learn everything that you have taught me.

I can affirm that you are a perfectly independent person, with the necessary skills to operate freely in Belgium and Europe. Don't worry about me, I will take my time to do whatever I need or want, if I need or want it. So, I would not like you to think that you can be a nuisance, annoyance, or a burden. Don't worry about me: I know hoe my mother is like and I know I won't have to take too much care of her. ;-)

Personally, I have the feeling of showing my gratitude and being thankful for everything you have taught me. But I don't know when or how often I will return to Valladolid, (Spain). The opportunity of continuing learning from you while giving back part of everything you have given me may not come easily. It seems to me that right now is the right time. I would like to spend as much time as possible with you in these moments, because in the future I do not know the distance that will separate us nor the ease and frequency of our meetings.

Since I don't want you to spend excessive money to come here, we can talk about different possibilities. As for the accommodation and other amenities, don't worry, you can sleep in my room and I can go to a friend's house. Or we can sleep, if you want, the two of us in the same room. We will be deciding by sharing our points of view.

“*You have to go empty to return full. You have to go back empty, to fill yourself*”. At the moment, neither you nor I know how to do it, but we try to learn enough to make it happen.

A warm and comforting hug,

Carlos

Hello, dear Carlos.
 
I greatly appreciate your letter and the encouragement that conveys and comforts me.
 
I am glad you are in such a plethoric moment, of well-being and happiness, with high expectations on the way to achievement. I am also encouraged to know that the small or great efforts we have been able to make for you and for your brothers have served you; that they have transmitted you knowledge and experiences; above all, I hope, of affection, emotion and love -which, on the other hand, it costs me so much to show sine a few years-; I hope that the moments lived during the first years of childhood and happiness weigh more.
 
Your offer fills me with satisfaction and I am sure that those days with you would be, as you say, of benefit, rest, and perfect for my state of mind, and, thus, be able to appreciate the many things that have been going through my mind lately. I agree with what you tell me and you propose -I think it is the right/necessary time and although it may serve as an excuse I would never feel like this-, I would love to take that trip and share with you the moments that your daily activity allows you, and your room , that you do not have to leave for me, with a sleeping bag I have enough. But it is possible that this is not the time, I went this morning to a selection test for an Ecyl teaching course, which I have wanted to do for years and I have the interview on the afternoon of the 27^th^. Until that moment, or one day later, I will not be able to seriously consider the trip, which causes a small conflict of interest, as I would undoubtedly prefer to be with you, but if I were selected it would be a great opportunity that I should not miss. We will see.
 
On the other hand, there is one more inconvenience. Your brothers have not finished the course they are doing and your father is working, things that morally bind me to this place, although it is not a great thing that I do for them, which on the other hand I do not feel be recognized, requested, or claimed.
 
In addition, you already know your father and his economical ideas, that so many inconsistencies and inconveniences pose to me in day to day and coexistence, not only with him, especially with you and in relation to my family. Something that would not pose any inconvenience, or doubt, if you really needed my help and/or presence.
 
I thank you very much for the effort and time you dedicate to me, especially when you are so busy, and the recognition or feeling of gratitude that you transmit, of positive value for what we do or try. And although I would like to have you close - you know that it really lasts little when you are physically- what really comforts me is that you are growing and achieving what you are interested in and you propose and what your future reward means. The disadvantage of distance is bearable when you see and value the benefit it provides, even if it is not always easy to accept or carry.
 
We continue in communication, accompanying ourselves in the search for the best, in continuous learning, on a daily basis, in the experiences of "emptying and fullness".
 
A warm and comforting hug.
 
Estrella

Hello C.,
 
We haven't talked in a while and I'd like to hear from you. (General and extremely open question that you can answer with the degree of detail and specificity that you want).
 
Please, if you find some time, I would appreciate it if you could write me a letter (by hand) and then send it to me by mail in an attached Word document. You can tell me how you are, how your studies are progressing or how you feel your life is evolving.
 
I will be your most attentive reader. If you have any concern or doubt about a topic, you know that you can always count on some of my clumsy advice.
 
A big hug,
 
Carlos

## 2014-02-26 To Ca. {-#toCa20140226}

2014-02-26

Hi Ca.,
 
At last, I have found a moment to write to you. Something that I have wanted to do for quite some time.
 
First of all, I highly recommend reading [*Flourish*](https://archive.org/details/flourishvisionar0000seli) by [Martin Seligman]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman) [@seligman2012flourish]. You should know that the book I recommend is not a self-help best seller, much less. Before making a criticism of positive psychology, you should bear in mind that the affirmations sustained in the book are methodologically obtained conclusions. Therefore, I consider the book of sufficient scientific validity to be respected. In this book, Seligman develops his [Theory of Well-Being]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman#Well-being). According to this theory, one of the factors that directly influences individual well-being is positive interpersonal relationships. I consider our relationship as positive; and that is why I believe it is necessary to make the effort to maintain it, to improve the well-being of both. Yesterday I fully realized that the fundamental thing about human relations consists in giving and not asking or taking.
 
So, I'll start by giving you a little bit of me (apart from the book's recommendation):

In these moments of my life, I am very calm and at ease with myself. Today, for example, I had an incredibly sociable and happy day. Full of well-being. I am being honest with myself, on a personal and spiritual level (I am reading the [Tao Te King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) [@ta1984tao]. We will talk about the Tao in the future if we consider it necessary.

My use of technologies is gradually approaching what I consider to be correct and measured. I have found time to read, write, learn and maintain the relationships that really matter to me and bring me; at the same time, I meet people who are incredibly amazing.

In this letter I would like to write to you about some of the advantages of remote letter communication. I will focus more specifically on the advantages of written communication, leaving aside the subject of writing as a reflective element and support for thought. What I write below, I hope, is part of a larger, more detailed and refined reflection, which may become part of an essay. I want to polish and improve this thinking as much as possible, to give it a much more perfect shape in the future. Therefore, I also hope that you will detect my argumentative weaknesses and the possible conditional clauses necessary to refine my ideas.
 
I would like to underline the fact that I want to discuss this topic with you because of some of the conversations we had in the past, about oral and written communication; or the value of writing as a the little sister of thought and support of it.

I hope to be able to cover the topic of writing and thinking with you in the future, since you also demonstrated to have a quite formed position on it^[Following I shared with C., my now [classical text about the advantages of writing letters]( https://www.carlitofluitoideas.com/writing-letters/).].

>ADVANTAGES OF LONG-DISTANCE, NON-NSTANT WRITTEN COMMUNICATION (BY LETTER) ^[Original post in Spanish published here.].
>
> There are some characteristics of written, non-immediate communication (by mail) that I consider advantages. Next, I will highlight some of them.
>
> Firstly, as an anecdotal fact, consider that written communication (by mail) has been the main, and practically the only, way of distant communication throughout long distances for most of our history as human beings. Moreover, some of the greatest thinkers have left us, as an essential sample of their thoughts, their epistolary texts with contemporary thinkers. In those letters, we can approach their thoughts and ideas, since writing offers an invaluable mechanism to transform a thought into something lasting and stable through time.
>
>From a more affectionate and relational perspective, I want to highlight the true interest shown on someone when a letter is written to them. Just the act of sitting down and write implies a prioritization of the interpersonal relationship upon multiple other possibilities. In essence, a fair amount of personal and individual time is dedicated to the other person, as well as your almost full attention.
>
>As proof, I am writing this text thinking about you right now. It feels as if I had you in front of me as if we were talking. I am dedicating my time and my attention entirely to you. My phone and my computer are shut down. [The original letter is hand-written, and it has suffered a process of digitalization and correction.] The reason to be hand-writing is to achieve a representation as pure and reliable as possible of my thoughts and feelings. Ultimately, to allow the flow of ideas and emotions subjected to minimal hindrance or modifications. This detail about handwriting seems essential to me in true long-distance communication. ^[2018-09-07, Erratum: We all change. I change. Nowadays, I type much more, and I sent most of my letters by email. I can elaborate on those aspects in a future post.]
>
>Secondly, I want to emphasize the freedom that writing gives both the writer/transmitter and the receiver. In the case of the transmitter, it has the freedom of taking as much time as needed to think, ponder, manifest and revise the content and format of the message. Thanks to this reviewed writing, the likability that the receiver (the other person) is going to read the actual message that was intended to be transmitted augments, decreasing the chances of the receiver decoding the message incorrectly. Therefore, the writer or transmitter needs to dedicate time to use the language appropriately, choosing correctly, with care and moderation the words and sentences in which the message is going to be shared. I presume that, in this way, a fair amount of misunderstandings are avoided. Misunderstandings occur easily in both oral and instant-messaging communication. I wouldn’t like to be interpreted as contrary to oral communication or instant messaging; since both of them are going to be discussed in future texts with calm, details, and nuances.
>
>In connection with my previous thoughts, it would be easy to use, as a counterargument, the slowness of handwriting, as compared to other communication channels. Surprisingly, using the hand-written communication channel in long-distance relationships can actually save time, given the fact that it helps to avoid errors or mistakes that tend to appear in oral communication and instant messaging. The transmitter has the possibility of reading the message as many times without needing to involve the receiver. Due to the lack of an expected and immediate feedback, the transmitter also saves time, since it doesn’t need a passive awaiting of an answer, but could dedicate this time to much more productive activities, such as sleeping.
>
>Another advantage, directly related to this idea of freedom that writing gives, is the independence that both the transmitter and the receiver enjoy when their communication is based on hand-written letters. Let’s use a reliable example: the moment when I’m writing this letter it’s a bright day and I am in Leuven. But when you read it, it won’t be necessary for you to be in Leuven or to be during the day. In fact, this freedom is so wide, that you could read this letter when and wherever you wanted to. When and wherever it suits you because it is already written. You don’t even have to answer it afterward, you don’t even need the transmitter to be alive to receive and decode the message. Besides, you could always recall this information whenever you needed it because it is already written. In addition to what has been previously mentioned, it is worth mentioning the incorruptibility of the message. In our particular case, with different time zones and locations that separate us, I find especially useful a hand-written communication channel. Personally, I believe that this particular characteristic of hand-written communication, the possibility of escaping the limits of time and space, places it in a privileged position when it comes to transmitting thoughts and ideas. The instantaneity of the communication, either oral or by instant messaging (WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype…) doesn’t grant any freedom neither to the transmitter, nor to the receiver: neither time to reflect upon their message, nor to use their spare time in different activities since they are both waiting for instant feedback from the other side.
>
>For these reasons, non-instant communication is the most suitable when the content of the message is prioritized over the feedback of the receiver (which is very egoistic). In other words, Instant messaging prevails when the consequences and the utility of the message gain importance over the value of the content. The new technologies have made us come to believe that speed is more important than the message itself. They’ve confused us by making us rush, driving us to an incomprehensible superficiality in personal relationships. The new technologies of immediacy, that claim to save time are, in my opinion, those actually stealing it. In future texts, I ’ll inquire deeply into this statement, sustained by different subordinate sentences.
>
>As a closure to my argumentation, I’ll expose a possible counterargument for the loss of spontaneity in interpersonal communication, or worse, the loss of spontaneity in the relationship between the transmitter and the receiver. I consider that this affirmation needs to be explained: I believe in written communication as a refinement and not as a loss of spontaneity. I do consider myself an active, vivacious and energetic person that treasures to a large extent the spontaneity of life. Written language could continue expressing a fair amount of this “spontaneity of life” despite the reflection and refinement attached to it. It is possible to deal with a minimal loss of this spontaneity at the expense of improving the expression and exposition of ideas. This is a price I am willing to pay. This way, we could concentrate this spontaneity in face-to-face relationships, which I consider fundamental for human beings’ emotional well-being. But this kind of spontaneity that technologies are defending seems to be a cheap imitation of actual communication, that doesn’t involve actual face-to-face spontaneity, neither reflection nor the refinement of expression that proper writing achieves.
>
>All things considered, I defend non-instant, long-distance written communication (by letter or mail) is the most accurate communication channel to keep positive interpersonal relationships at a long distance. With letters, a true bonding and interest towards the other person are shown, alongside a search to deeply engage in the relationship; while using the new technologies from the immediacy era what is actually pursued is utilitarianism and superficiality in personal relationships, including also the telephone or video conferences.  I believe that a connection made through shared written thoughts is more real, deeper and true than one created with on different colored pixels forming some image similar to a face on a screen and a robotic voice coming out of the speaker. Referring to sensations, I would rather look at a photograph (if printed, better) of me and a friend in some lost place in the world and then try to listen to his or her voice in my head while I read his words. Also, why the rush? What for? If you really care about keeping the relationship alive you ought to give some of your time exclusively to that person, stop and think of him or her and write them. This should be a clear proof of devotion and interest for the reader, and not any ‘How’s going?’ sent by Whatsapp.

Well, C., I think I have made a good argument about the value of distance communication, not immediate, by letter. I hope to receive your answer in the future.
 
Now simply, conclude this letter by saying that I would like to hear from you. As you will have detected throughout my argumentation, I am not in a hurry. I hope to receive your emails with a variable frequency. Take the time you want and need. You already know that I am very tranquil and calm. I hope that out of respect for me, and more importantly, for you, you write something that lives up to your potential and intellect, which we both know, is not at all scarce. Furthermore, your usage of Spanish is admirable. With which I would very much like to be able to read an exhibition of ideas stylistically speaking, impeccable. You can comment on any of the topics that I suggest throughout the letter if you wish, starting with your presentation of ideas.

In future letters, we will catch up on more mundane and personal matters, whenever you like. But I consider this first introductory letter as a fundamental element for the future and development of our relationship.
 
A big hug,
 
Your Friend-Brother Carlos

2014-02-27

Greetings J.,
 
The following reflection is based on the first chapter of Martin Seligman's Flourish book, which I highly recommend reading, since in addition to learning you will notice an increase in your level of wellbeing.

In this chapter Seligman makes a brief description of the [*Theories of Authentic Happiness*](http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Happiness-Psychology-Potential-Fulfillment/dp/0743222989/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381506809&sr=8-1&keywords=authentic%20happiness) [@seligman2004authentic] and his [*Theory of Well-Being*](https://www.amazon.com/Flourish-Visionary-Understanding-Happiness-Well-being/dp/1439190763/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381506783&sr=8-1&keywords=flourish) [@seligman2012flourish].

I attach the summary of the chapter to guide you in my argument.
 
 
> <center>**SUMMARY OF WELL-BEING THEORY**</center>
> 
>Here then is well-being theory: well-being is a construct; and well-being, not happiness, is the topic of positive psychology. Well-being has five measurable elements (PERMA) that count toward it:
>
> - Positive emotion (of which happiness and life satisfaction are two aspects)
>
> - Engagement
> 
> - Relationships
>
> - Meaning
>
> - Achievement
> 
> None of the element defines well-being individually, but each contributes to it. Some aspects of these five elements are measured subjectively by self-report, but other aspects are measured objectively.
>
> In the *Authentic Happiness Theory* by contrast, happiness is the centerpiece of positive psychology. It is a real thing that is defined by the measurement of life satisfaction. Happiness has three aspects: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning, each of which feeds into life satisfaction and is measured entirely by subjective report.
>
> There is one loose end to clarify: in authentic happiness theory, the strengths and virtues — kindness, social intelligence, humor, courage, integrity, and the like (there are twenty-four of them) —are the supports for engagement. You go into flow when your highest strengths are deployed to meet the highest challenges that come your way. In well-being theory, these twenty-four strengths underpin all five elements, not just engagement: deploying your highest strengths leads to more positive emotion, to more meaning, to more accomplishment, and to better relationships.
>
>Authentic happiness theory is one-dimensional: it is about feeling good and it claims that the way we choose our life course is to try to maximize how we feel. Well-being theory is about all five pillars, the underpinnings of the five elements is the strengths. Well-being theory is plural in method as well as substance: positive emotion is a subjective variable, defined by what you think and feel. Engagement, meaning, relationships, and accomplishment have both subjective and objective components, since you can believe you have engagement, meaning, good relations, and high accomplishment and be wrong, even deluded. The upshot of this is that well-being cannot exist just in your own head: well-being is a combination of feeling good as well as actually having meaning, good relationships, and accomplishment. The way we choose our course in life is to maximize all five of these elements.
>
> This difference between happiness theory and well-being theory is of real moment. Happiness theory claims that the way we make choices is to estimate how much happiness (life satisfaction) will ensue, and then we take the course that maximizes future happiness. Maximizing happiness is the final common path of individual choice. As economist Richard Layard argues, that is how individuals choose and in addition maximizing happiness should become the gold standard measure for all policy decisions by government. Richard, the advisor to both prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown on unemployment, and my good friend and teacher, is a card-carrying economist, and his view — for an economist — is remarkable. It sensibly departs from the typical economist’s view of wealth: that the purpose of wealth is to produce more wealth. For Richard, the only rationale for increasing wealth is to increase happiness, so he promotes happiness, not only as the criterion by which we choose what to do as individuals, but as the single outcome measure that should be measured by government in order to decide what policies to pursue. While I welcome this development, it is another naked monism, and I disagree with the idea that happiness is the be-all and end-all of well-being and its best measure.
 >
> The final chapter of this book is about the politics and economics of well-being, but for now I want to give just one example of why happiness theory fails abysmally as the sole explanation of how we choose. It is well established that couples with children have on average lower happiness and life satisfaction than childless couples. If evolution had to rely on maximizing happiness, the human race would have died out long ago. So clearly either humans are massively deluded about how much life satisfaction children will bring or else we use some additional metric for choosing to reproduce. Similarly, if personal future happiness were our sole aim, we would leave our aging parents out on ice floes to die. So the happiness monism not only conflicts with the facts, but it is a poor moral guide as well: from happiness theory as a guide to life choice, some couples might choose to remain childless. When we broaden our view of well-being to include meaning and relationships, it becomes obvious why we choose to have children and why we choose to care for our aging parents.
>
> Happiness and life satisfaction are one element of well-being and are useful subjective measures, but well-being cannot exist just in your own head. Public policy aimed only at subjective well-being is vulnerable to the Brave New World caricature in which the government promotes happiness simply by drugging the population with a euphoriant called “soma.” Just as we choose how to live by plural criteria, and not just to maximize happiness, truly useful measures of well-being for public policy will need to be a dashboard of both subjective and objective measures of positive emotion, engagement, meaning, good relationships, and positive accomplishment.

From the above, the part that I would like to highlight is the one that relates the Theory of Well-Being with the Theory of Evolution. We are then faced with the danger of thinking that the search for happiness, understood as the maximization of positive affect, is the most appropriate path to follow. Seligman offers the example of couples with and without children and care for parents in support of this idea.
 
The origin of this reflection is the conversation we had at the beginning of the course in which, more or less correctly, you argued that the goal of life was to be happy. That day I did not completely agree with your opinion, but until reading the previous text I have not known why. Your statement, partially correct, has to be subjected to various nuances. Some of these nuances are already included in Seligman's reasoning. The search for happiness (positive emotions) is only part of the individual's complete well-being. Thus, let’s assume, that the goal in people's lives is to flourish, to increase individual and other human well-being.
 
Next, I will present a personal example within the framework of Theory of Well-being. My example is focused on highlighting the nuance between the search for happiness and the search for personal well-being. For this I will use any university student. That university student whose main objective is the search for Happiness and the maximization of positive emotions, will be in constant search and movement for these. His main activities and motivations could be: going out to a party, having coffee with his friends, enjoying his free time walking, watching series or movies, etc. On the other hand, a university student whose objective is searching for their own flourishing and their individual well-being will be more likely to compensate their study hours with leisure hours. I consider that under objective measures, the second student will have higher levels of well-being than the previous one. Being possible that the first student shows, objectively measured, higher levels of happiness.
 
The maladaptiveness of happiness in this case will be shown in their academic performance. We can assume that the student oriented towards the pursuit of happiness will demonstrate a lower motivation towards their studies, since studying does not usually provoke positive affective states. This lower motivation may affect negatively the time and effort used by the student on their tasks. This lack of intrinsic motivation to study, on multiple occasions, will cause feelings of distress, tiredness, and boredom. On the other hand, relying on Well-being theory, the most adaptive attitude for a university student is to pursue their personal flourishing. As reflected in the chapter, the theory of Well-being is made up of five elements, three of them, common with the constructor of Happiness.

According to the first of these, *positive emotions*, the student whose attitude is the search for Well-being, will try to go out to party, drink coffee, watch series ... to a lesser extent probably, due to time limitations, than the student oriented in pursuit of happiness. But still, it will demonstrate an attitude of seeking positive emotions. The second element, *engagement* or *flow*, is a state reached when the person feels completely absorbed in completing a task. The task must be challenging and complex so that all the student's attention is focused on it and it can reach a state of Flow. Both students may have more or less experiences of flow performing a wide variety of tasks, but I lean on the idea that the student who varies more often from task has a greater opportunity to find himself in situations of flow, than the one who performs with higher frequency and monotony the same activities. The third element, *meaning*, is found in the performance of activities that are considered bigger and more important than the individual himself. As an example of these activities we can name the motivation to learn or apply knowledge with the aim of helping humanity. Conversely, selfish acts of pleasure are not usually related to the idea of meaning. The element of *accomplishment* is an idea that I personally relate to the concept of learning goals [@locke1990theory]. These types of goals provoke an intrinsic motivation oriented towards learning or mastering a certain task. In such a situation, people who demonstrate higher learning or accomplishment goals will have higher levels of well-being. As Seligman well argues, it is more likely to find this type of goals and objectives in tasks that pose a personal challenge to overcome, something that most leisure activities do not provoke. Finally, we find the element called *positive relationships*. A student who spends a larger portion of their time working will spend a lesser portion socializing, compared to socializing being a priority. The student who has less time to socialize must hierarchize and organize their time more efficiently to focus their efforts on those relationships that contribute and matter to them. Focusing like this, on relationships and people who really care about him. Assuming the above, their well-being will also be increased, even in a higher way, than that of a student who socializes without too much discrimination. It is interesting to note that these elements are characterized by their fundamentally intrinsic motivation. Such motivation is the most powerful and enduring engine of behavior. Thus, increasing the chances of academic success for the student whose goal is Well-being compared to the chances of the student whose goal is purely Happiness. And most importantly, the levels of Well-being of the student whose goal is the pursuit of Well-being will also be higher than those of the one whose goal is purely the pursuit of Happiness.
 
Regards,
 
Carlos

2014-02-28

Oh Carlos!

You make me feel an expert in contradiction ... Well, in truth it has been almost always like that. And precisely for that reason that you call quality communication. Communication that, between us, has been quite poor in my opinion.
 
Recently, a wise man told me that we end up loving those who transmit us tranquility and we end up hating those who stress us. And so, it goes!
 
You "stressed" me when you told me that in the future ... and reassures me when you write to me sincerely and with time ... It was not so difficult to explain that you were involved and that you would answer me in time one day, instead of putting ... *We spoke in the future!* Is it the same? Yes, but often the container is as important as the content. In conclusion, the forms.
 
I am very glad that you are as well as you tell me and I really think you deserve it, since you have been looking for yourself for a long time. And in that sense, I'm glad that you get closer and closer to yourself and shape yourself.
 
As for me, you already know that I am the same as always. Increasingly away from social conventions and closer to my personal conventions. Deciding who and how I want to be. And assuming the costs and benefits that this entails. Smiling to life when it smiles at me and smiling again when it doesn't because I have learned to tickle it. I have learned that the difficult is achieved and the impossible is attempted.
 
I'm fine, wanting to live this end of the degree and then have more time for myself ... I think next year will be a sabbatical year of study, since I assume that English will have to be part of my being (at the end I accepted it) and I wish I could live for a while in some small town in Ireland. Learning English and defining myself. I have finally lost the rush. And it has cost me lots, but it is the best. Not to think about what is coming tomorrow but to dwell on what I have today. And today I have this letter in my hands, which I am very happy about.
 
I want to see you but see you as I have read in the letter. Serene and sincere. Although mistakes belong to our learning and we both made many mistakes, I think that it is not necessary to do more harm. Nor to venture that if there were possible future errors they will belong to our learning. If they do, they will belong to our learning, but growing is learning to say goodbye on many occasions. And of course, it is not about blaming, that is for Christians, we must try to take responsibility for our actions.
 
I hope that if there is another letter you are as good as up to now or better. And tell me a little bit if you plan to come to the graduation. I guess it was because you asked me something. You already know that I don’t care much about these things. I graduate yes, but I don't know the day or anything ... (You know living in the present and ... that's May right? Hehehe).
 
What was said, I hope you are very well and I send you a huge hug.
 
Your friend: S.!!

## 2014-03-02. Letter to the deaths. - Self-deception {-#todeath2014-03-02}

Hello Tom (1991 - 2007)

Hello Monica (1989 - 2011)

I’m writing to you in a selfish way. Because I need you. I need to write to someone. I need to tell someone what I’m learning . I’m self- deceiving  myself, thinking that I’m not taking time out from you, because for you there is nothing left. You have plenty of time now that you’re not here. I’m deceiving myself because I need you. I need to write to you.

I think I’m giving you something, and even  dead, I’m taking away from you. I hope you are in peace, and I’m not bothering you with this letter.  I need people, I need the lies. Still. I just realise that I am not going to be able to study the Social Networks Master’s Degree next year, since I missed the deadline. It seems even  funny to know that I was already dead. I had been dead for a month and I didn’t know it. That I had one of the happiest weeks of my life and my future was dead. That I was living the present, happy. Filled with wellbeing . Helping the world. All of this thanks to my past, thanks to forgetting my past, to emptying my heart, filling my stomach, weakening my ambitions and strengthening my bones. I was happy, infinitely happy. Blooming, productive. In less than a week I went from consuming cannabis to considering seriously not killing  animals for my own benefit or consumption.

I abandoned my self,  my egoism. I have emptied myself, my morality is now  focused on the other.  I couldn’t steal if its other’s belongings, I couldn’t steal knowing that somebody needs  more than me. I couldn’t breathe if my oxygen would cause someone else’s death. I’ve given in, I’ve emptied myself. But I fill myself. I fill myself often.

Ambitions. I need this letter for working for the world, for them, for those alive. For every person that is still here. I needed to talk to those over there to realise that I have to work for this world. I must share this happiness and wellbeing that I have achieved. To spread and to give. Life is giving, therefore I’m begging to the Death. So that the Death gives to life what it takes from it.  

From a cemetery,I’m writing. From a cemetery, I learn. Because the living, with thedead, are still connected. That is why I want to study Social Networks becausekeeping my happiness is selfish because watching suffering calmly is selfish,being willing to change is ambition, but enjoying other’s suffering is egotistic.

And I’m alone, and I’m not alone. Because people exist. Because I cannot change anybody. The change is within each one, and outside, through writing. Talking to the dead and taking from the Death what it takes from us every day. We want It to give our life back. But prayers are selfish, writing is sharing. I’m writing for myself and on behalf of others. Because my letters have a receiver, even if they’re dead. Because it remains written, and any alive person will read it. Because I empty myself giving, and I fill myself back by emptying other people. Because I search for calm, and I give calm. I don’t hold it. 

Icreate emptiness in my body, so I can host others within me. 

And I don’t ask for anything in return. I don’t ask for anything they aren’t willing to give. I have air, water, food, and people. I have an empty glass to be filled.

2014-03-02

Hi S.,
 
I don't know why I write to you again. I have more people that I should write to and reply to in advance. I suppose it is wanting to continue in my comfort zone for a little while longer. Please, I ask you to understand this selfish act which is to use you as the recipient of my thoughts. I do not ask you to forgive me, as you already said that is for Christians, only that you understand me, that you try to learn from all the situations in your life, even from this act of selfishness.
 
At first guilt and hatred appear, combined with anger and fury. If I steal your time by forcing you to read this letter, you have full right to blame me. Eventually sadness may appear. Sadness caused by seeing a person who needs another to empty themselves, to be able to shape their thinking and be more comfortable with themselves. Pity caused by my lack of independence, by my vulnerability. And finally, you may even appreciate observing the beauty of dependency and the need of other human beings in our ephemeral life. The inherent social character that identifies us. That is, at least, what I am experiencing almost every day. Sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously. First, I hate and blame; then I am sorry for the fragility of the other person; and in the end, I thank them for everything I learn thanks to our interaction.
 
I have the need to write to you because today has been a day that has destabilized much of the calm that I had and that I am winning. I tell you the situation:

A couple of days ago I made the decision to go to northern Europe to study a master in social networks. Today, looking at it on the Internet, I have seen that many deadlines had been passed. I also need a degree in English that I do not have. Last month, you recommended me to do sports in stressful situations. That day I listened to you. But today, running 14 kilometers was not going to be productive or sufficient. Still, I needed to run away. Run away from reality and the world for a while. My coping strategies tend to be seeking social support, in part, that's why I am writing this letter to you. The bike took me to a friend's house, which wasn’t there. My cell phone was in my room, so I couldn't call anyone. Moments later, I was praying to a friend, thinking about the letter I was going to write to him: "Hello Sergio, I'm writing to you today because ..." Then the bike took me to a cemetery. I have left Sergio's time for Sergio, and I have written a letter to the dead. I have apologized for stealing their time and have written addressing them. (If you are interested, I can send you what I have written) This experience has helped me grow a lot in a very short time. Right now, I'm not completely well, but I'm much better. Emptying myself again. So, despite being upsetting you right now, if in the future I will stop receiving responses to my letters from my interlocutors, I could write to the dead again. But I prefer life, I prefer the living. I am learning to adapt, learning to be water.
 
Today, too, I have solved another dilemma that had been taking up significant space in my head for a long time.

>"*A handful of rice, once counted, continues to be the same handful of rice.*"

We can let science discover the world without destroying it, without fear of annihilating the spontaneity of life. But to count rice you have to be patient and count slowly. Counting too quickly causes failure. The reason the rice started to be counted was the precision of the distribution. But if you try to separate a badly counted rice into two halves, they will no longer be perfect halves. The rush of science leads to atomic bombs and poorly counted rice.
 
Regarding your letter, I have to tell you that I am incredibly amazed at the great wisdom of your words and your potential as a person and writer. You capture the essence with few words and little information. You go beyond what I mean. Sometimes, even beyond what I had thought myself. You help me a lot to organize my ideas and that's why also, selfishly, I find myself writing to you again.
 
I love that you talk about the contradiction. The knowledge that I am discovering these days is the paradoxical one. The contradiction in the contradiction. I think the only truths that exist are lies. From ["*I only know that I know nothing*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing), through "*The Love and the Death*" [@val2011orfeo], to ["*The name that can be defined is not the unchanging name.*"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) [@ta1984tao].

I share your point of view about our communication in the past. I think it was never a quality communication. This deficiency, in part, caused by haste. I am discovering the reward of waiting, of patience. To get out of my comfort zone. From being water, from enjoying any situation, from learning in the desert. 

>"*I thank the desert for teaching me to be thirsty.*"
 
Be close to wise people, like the one who told you that one lovse those who transmit us tranquility. The people who calm and reassure us are the ones who make us feel most comfortable with ourselves. If you feel that your life needs calm, perfect. Look for it, and hopefully find it. On the contrary, right now, I'm looking for learning. Maximum adaptability to any situation. If needed, that I can convey calm even in the worst of situations. If needed, just the opposite. Being water.
 
>"*Water is beneficient to all things but does not contend.*" [@ta1984tao].

An anecdote as an example. On Friday, I managed to party without talking to a friend, who expressly asked me not to speak to her all night. The problem is that when we are together, we absorb each other. Selfishly, we forget that the rest of the world keeps spinning. It was a fantastic night for both of us, both when we were together and when we were apart.
At the end of the night she said goodbye kissing me, adding the value that her kisses possess. "*I have them numbered. I don't even give them to my mother.*” I was calm. Drinking water, sitting in the chair. I smiled at her and watched her go. I was enjoying that beautiful moment of emptiness and fullness for a long time. A night of unmeasurable learning. All because she had told me to shut my mouth. I will be eternally grateful to her. From guilt, to grief, to gratitude.
 
Again, you are right when you talk about forms. It’s not the same. Language is the structure of the mind. It is our working tool (that of psychologists). The forms, the forms. You would be surprised at the care I have been giving to oral communication lately. When I'm calm, I speak better English, I spend a few seconds forming impersonal sentences, I try to say “*Thank you*” and “*You're welcome*”, I remember the proper names (sometimes I don't believe it myself!). A few days ago, a new idea appeared. Name the countries, cities and people by their original names. Greece happens to be Ελλάδα / Elláda / and Thailandia, ประเทศไทย / pratheidthai /. People appreciate it. It is respect, it is time and it is interest in the person and in their culture. Because Michael is not / michael /, is / maikel /. That is his name, and those are forms. I try to learn "*Hello*", "*Goodbye*", "*Thank you*" and "*You're welcome*" in the language of my interlocutor. But the vast interculturality of this place makes it difficult to remember so much information. So, you are right, and as a psychological and human being, I consider that we must take care of the forms. Of course, I apologize for stressing you out with my bad manners, but I would also like to pity you for knowing that there are people who have such a hard time learning manners. In the end, you may even be grateful for showing yourself that the world is plural and that people like me can also learn good manners. Guilt, sadness and gratitude.
 
Thanks for telling me that I deserve to be finding my way. But I think it's something that had to happen, like everything that has happened to me in this life. Everything has happened to get here today and now. To write this to you. And there is no fault. There is no fault.

>"*Since there is no contention, there is no blame.*" [@ta1984tao].

You are incredible right that I have been searching for a long time. But I think it's something that I will never finish doing or at least, I never want to finish doing it. The deeper I go, the more I feel like I don't know myself. The more experiences I have, the more I realize what I have left to learn, and the infinity of past mistakes.

I love that you find your way. I really am pleased. I hope you continue to shape yourself, seeking yourself. There are no costs if nothing is expected, and all are benefits if there is only learning. Filling is possible after emptying. Please keep your characteristic joviality, which makes your face so pentagonally beautiful. Rice, like beauty, even if measured, is still beauty. The difficult and the impossible are forgotten. Once forgotten and with an empty spirit, it is tried. As something new, as something that is not known if it can be done or not. Ignorantly happy, without knowing its difficulties: none, some or extreme. Empty. If at first there is no success: learn and forget again. Always try again and again differently. Because you are, I am, we are, water looking for our way among the stones of the river of life. New water with new stones and new obstacles.
 
I am pleased to know that you want to finish the degree, that you want time for yourself. As I have already told you, I had a life project for next year and after making the decision everything has fallen apart.^[*03/10/2014*: Reviewing the letter I have remembered your almost trip to South America. I would like to know how you took it then. We did not talk too much at that time ...] But everything that has happened has been necessary to learn. Just as it was to lose my phone, although later I recovered it. Now I ask myself again what and how do I want to continue. I have also made the decision to get the English qualification I need, write and study online. Managing the tool, instead of being handled by it. Internet and the computer are very useful if one knows how to use them.
 
 
What you now have in your hands is water, which gives you its infinite freshness. It refreshes your skin and cools your spirit. Water is wise. It is renewed and maintains its freshness. The freshness of your hands.

Enjoy the feeling that the water produces. Every moment, every nuance, every water. Savor the differences of the moments. Remember the rain and the loquacious molecules^[Unpublished reference]. Let it rain on you. Fill your hands with water destined to disappear.

Today I read something about time in the *Tao Te Ching* that may stimulate you. I am writing it to you as a result of your comment on time and haste.

>“Meet it, you cannot see its face;
>Follow it, you cannot see its back. ”
 
I cannot add anything else because I am not sure I have understood even its simplest meaning. I leave everything to you.
 
I am very glad that my previous letter brought you some happiness. I also want to see you. But, until that happens, many things will change, and will continue to change because the river is sometimes serene, and sometimes not. We are water influenced by the terrain in which we will run. I'm learning not to contain, to empty myself, to control myself, to be happy. Although we are wrong again. Although we love and/or kill each other. (The paradox of love: you can love death and die from love. You can be immortal). But whatever happens, and even if it doesn't happen, it will be learning, and it will be forgotten. It will be growth. Happens or doesn’t happen. We have to learn from non-existence. If my friend had been at her house today when I went looking for her, I would not have grown so much in such a short time. Maybe not seeing each other is best. I do not know yet. But without doubt, in case of seeing each other, I will try to be empty and new. To fill myself with you and learn from every second with you. Even if it's just a two-second look. If you are not; I will learn a lot, alone and I may blame you for not being there; then sadden myself for not being able to share with you my moments of happiness; and finally, thank you for teaching me and giving me the wonderful opportunity to grow. And if there is no guilt there is no forgiveness, because there is no responsibility. People teach me, and the only thing my heart produces is gratitude.
 
At the moment, I don't know if I can say that I am as well as in the previous letter, or worse, or better. I have grown a lot, but I still do my best to keep growing and feel comfortable with myself again. I am in the middle of a simultaneous explosion and implosion.

To the graduation, in principle if I go. I land on Madrid the 29^th^ and take off from Santander the 6^th^. I think graduation is May 3^rd^, I'm not sure. If you say that you don’t care of those things, I am surprised that each day is tomorrow and not yesterday or next year, or the year before. I am losing all notion of time, but if I stop running and chasing the unattainable present, I look back and find sheets of paper, letters, ideas and experiences that I want to share with the world before I go and leave the birds singing.

Thanks for your time.
 
A hug

P.S. I would like to know a very absurd detail about your habits, if you continue smoking or not; and why do you continue or stopped doing it.

## 2014-03-04 To L. {-#toL20140304}

2014-03-04

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck L.! I would make love to you a thousand times right now! (Dedicated to all who think that communication by letter loses spontaneity) What a piece of letter. I knew it, I knew it! I knew you could do it and you've shown me. Perfect. Seriously. Paragraphs with defined ideas, correct use of language, clear exposition, easy to read ... My most sincere congratulations Lu. Seriously. I knew you could do it.

If you want, I tell you two little details, but do not take them into account much, they are trivialities: 

-  The expression plant time and collect hours with fruit is understood, but it sounds a bit strange and it is difficult to process it. (However, I recently used the expression plant time as well.)

-  Time can evaporate, but “*dissipate*” sounds a little weird. (I read it now and it sounds better.)

Otherwise, incredible. I do not know what method you have used, if a personal one or the video I sent you, but the result is incredible. L. continue like that. Now I can answer you.
 
L.,
 
It's okay to stop when we've been running over because of hurries for a long time. But I realized this during exam times, where stopping was very dangerous and could have had expensive consequences. Therefore, I learned to take note so as not to forget and leave for further the depth or solution of the problem.
 
If it helps, try to focus your attention on the studies and as soon as an idea or a thought comes to your mind, write it down in a few words or lines so as not to forget it and continue studying. You have to empty yourself to continue filling
 
>“*Clay is molded into vessels*
>
> *And because of the space where nothing exists we are able to use them as vessels*” 
>
>
> [@ta1984tao].
 
If all goes well, you will be able to keep one hundred percent of your attention most of the time, simply assaulted by sporadic ideas that you will be leaving aside, but without fear of forgetting them. Your mind will be much clearer and emptier. Yesterday I wrote a letter with the following to my mother. 

>“*You have to go empty to return full. You have to go back empty, to fill yourself.* ” 
>
>
> [2014-02-24 To my mother.]

Still, if you think it will save more time taking a day or some time to empty yourself as completely as you can, do it without a doubt. Do not repress yourself. On many occasions we must allow ourselves to be guided by intuition. As I guess, by now you know that technology is distracting. Try to keep what you do as physical and less digitized as possible.
 
>"Not showing what is desirable keeps their hearts from confusion"
>
>
>[@ta1984tao]
 
I hope that my advice solves part of your problems regarding priorities, distractions and attention.

That time is consumed vertiginously does not have to be a bad sign, as long as it is filled with something that empties the spirit. It is normal to feel tired and overwhelmed after long periods of stress. Try to relax and surround yourself with people who support you. For now, being with people who love you will help you a lot. Later, I hope, you will find a personal way to cope with the day to day in a more independent way. When it comes to deepening and internalizing, the technology of instant communication never helps, but instead causes superficiality and externalization, both at the level of external knowledge and personal knowledge. (Knowledge of existence and non-existence.)
 
It is necessary to make mistakes in order to grow. We are made of mistakes. It’s needed to make mistakes to learn what everyone gives of themselves and what time allows to do. Don't get overwhelmed, and don't forget to enjoy life, but if Scouts are going to be a burden and a source of more stress than well-being, make the decision you feel it will benefit you more. You also learn to say no. Over time, we do not know how long it will take and let’s not worry about the rush, you will learn what you need to learn. Learning is always present, and lessons will come. That the lessons and mistakes are repeated over and over again is not a bad thing. Don't blame yourself, you are supposed to repeat the lessons until they are learned. It's life, don't worry and don't blame yourself. Don't keep it either, let everything flow.

>"Since there is no contention, there is no blame."
>
>
>[@ta1984tao]
 
Regarding your last question, I think that organization and knowing how to say “*no*” are two factors out of an infinity of them that intervene in our lives. They may be the most important to you right now. Learn the lesson, forget it and empty yourself again. Today, for example, I have decided to change the schedule of my English course, because Mondays from 9:00 to 21:30 are too long for me. I was not taking advantage of my time and effort in the most productive and effective way. So, instead of closing in on the stubbornness of: "*I have to do it, because I have a commitment*"; I have accepted it.
 
>"*Therefore the Sage rules*
>
>*By* […],
>
>*Weakening their ambitions.*"
>
>
>[@ta1984tao]
 
I have limits, and I have changed. We are water.
 
>"*The highest goodness is like Water*"
>
>
>[@ta1984tao]
 
Well it looks like this is all I can tell you. I hope I have helped you as what I like to be, your friend, and not your psychologist.
 
A kiss.
 
Carlos.


## 2014-03-04 To T. {-#toT20140304}

2014-03-04

Hello Tomas,
 
I answer following the order of your letter.
 
Thank you for your letter and thank you for the congratulations on my studies, but I would not like you to overestimate me. Overvaluations lead to disappointment. Personally, I prefer not to have too many expectations and that when things happen, I simply thank the actors in the action for their wonderful performance. Ambitions, even if they come from other people, are usually not too beneficial for the organism.
 
Regarding Erasmus, and the population in general, every day I believe more in individual differences, so the generalizations about Erasmus or other social groups do not make me very happy, even if they are positive. The only generalization that I like to make is that of the capacity to love of the human being, and still, I know that there are exceptions.
 
I have not the remotest idea of [Leibniz]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), nor of the government of the world, nor of God. But I believe that the world belongs to the world, and [nature is a loan from our children and not an inheritance from our parents]( https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/22/borrow-earth/). So, on a personal level, God makes little. I can only congratulate you on the great work you do as a philosopher and student of Leibniz. I, personally, am already learning to walk with doubts and without them. To write, to forget the past, to learn from the past, to empty myself, to remember the past, to fill myself up again and to empty myself again. Life is change. We are water.
 
On the matter of time. From my point of view, the problem is that, now, time is not only lacking for intellectuals, among whom I do not include myself. Time is lacking for everyone (except Africans, horrible generalization). Asking around me, (I do not know if it will happen to you, that you frequent much less mundane circles), if they believe that people have time, or if they themselves have time, they respond quickly that they don’t, as they lower their heads towards their new Smartphone or keep on looking at a screen, infinitely entertained and empty (or overwhelmed?). The lack of time of the current population, I can almost assert, is caused, among many other factors, by an excessive use (abuse) of instant communication technologies. These technologies were gifted by the gurus of speed and design ([Steve Jobs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)) as if it were humanity's new panacea. A gift that, by the way, is expensive inside and outside the store.
 
To this day, I sit down to watch the sunset and savor the seconds if that is what my spirit needs. Still, I suppose, you'll be pleased to hear that I don't waste time. At least, not as much as before. I take more care of my social relationships and I am more productive. Maybe I should follow the schedule that I set for myself a little more verbatim. But for now, being water is not bad for me. And I usually meet deadlines. Minus one ... I'll tell you ... There is another deadline, the only one I would say, that speeds me up. It forces me not to lose my, our, and their time. I work for humanity, and humanity has many pending problems and tasks that have to be solved. At least, trying to avoid causing new problems and mishaps that, if we let them grow, will be much more difficult to solve in the future.
 
I could and, of course you could, write an entire essay with just this sentence: 

>“*In any case, in this time of weak, mercantile thought, lost amidst the superficiality of appearance, of manipulations everywhere, of manipulative media and incensed, of word-laborers, rascals, market-goers, cynics, in short; at this time, to the obligations and commitments of studies and knowledge, we usually unite the eating of the media, which dilute our time, the ability to think, they manipulate us, and even shape our moral conscience.*"
>
>  [2014-02-22 From T.]

So, I can't afford to comment on it. For now, let's move on to the next one.
 
[Bauman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman) liquid society [@bauman2013liquid] is an idea that I will try to discover when it fits into my busy interior. If it ever fits. “*Liquid society liquidates...*” (Interesting, but I lack information) For me, the most liquid thing is water, and water adapts to any situation. But even water has a social conscience.

Thanks for your advice about pecking everything and digging deep in little. But I think that contrary to being a defect is your wonderful virtue. T., you are a very knowledgeable person and in the contemporary world I think that are needed more varied and complete heads instead of squared specialists, experts in a single field. It is easy to fool the engineer with politics and the politician with engineering. Education makes us free T., and being an expert in nothing and wise in everything (just like you, but you are also an expert in Leibniz), is one of the cures of our sick society. Even so, I have made a decision, that like water, I do not know how long it will last. I am going to try to focus on only, (on only!), 3 or 4 things: social networks, positive psychology, and read in my spare time the classics of Eastern and Western philosophy (I do not like to discriminate). I am very sorry for arts and international politics. But one does not have time for everything. I will try to enjoy the delights of art in an ignorant way and see the political passing from the stands, without intervening too much. It is all I can do. Still, I would like that my artistic part would help me financially. I am preparing a couple of performances and looking for centers to give dance classes. So, I can leave the free time to the intellect.
 
By the way, it is convenient to speak in future letters about the classics, which, I have noticed, first-hand, that save a lot of time.
 
This part of the letter is a little more serious.
 
If something I tell you or write about this subject unleashes your intellect, please write to me, in the same way that you have taught us. Write, but I ask you to keep it. Save it for when I'm ready for your words. Moment which, I don't know if it will come.
 
One classic in particular, [Lao Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi), is saving me entire volumes on ethics and science, human morals, self-help best sellers, and even psychology books. I am reading the [*Tao Te Ching*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) and my mind is reaching new places. "*It's the best drug I've ever taken,*" I was surprised telling a friend the other day. I don't want to tell you about the experience because:
 
>"*The Tao that can be expressed is not the eternal Tao*"
>
> [@ta1984tao].
 
> "*He who talks more is sooner exhausted*
>
> *It is better to keep what is within himself.*”
>
> [@ta1984tao]
 
The negative effects of this drug, if any, are yet to be discovered.
 
But right now, I don't want objective (western) criticism or analysis of something infinitely subjective. I do not want relationships or ties between philosophy or western and eastern religions. I don't want a teacher. I want to think for myself. ("[*Sapere Aude*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapere_aude)"... It went out already...). I want to develop my own ideas.

The thoughts and ideas that occur to me, I try to support them with the most resistant arguments that I find. I try to soak up everything I know, without trying to close myself to anything. As with [Bukowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski), if I need help at any time, I will let you know. But now, I want to enjoy this knowledge, these ideas and feelings so holistic that the reading of the Tao is causing my body. Something completely new to me.
 
Sorry if that fear that I have bothers you. But I remember the brief [analysis on that song]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2A2Na2wIA8) that I sent to you and F., where a [Hindu spiritual thinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh) (Eastern Philosophy) spoke about [love and hate]( http://yaqui.co/music/2013/2/8/klangkarussell-netzwerk). I remember the harshness, criticism and, unfortunately, apparent success that you expressed with your words. I don't want to know yet your probably western and correct interpretation of the Tao. I prefer to know and investigate on my own, before westernizing and criticizing. Furthermore, I am completely ignorant of both the western and eastern parts of philosophy, its culture and an infinity of other things. So, I am a very influential person and, not even by chance, I can criticize anything.
 
To appease any of your possible concerns, I assure you that I am still a person committed to the planet and the human species. My social sense has grown exponentially. I am not going to go to live to Tibet the rest of my life, because the world needs me. Still, I know I could be happy there until death reached me. I'll pay F. the plane ticket, let’s see if he leaves us alone for a while and calms down a bit. (He has been very angry lately, but I keep quiet.) If at any time you notice that I stray too far from ethical principles and put an individual and self-fulfilling pleasant experience before a collective well-being, please, I would also like you to warn me.
 
Attached in the mail is a poem written the morning of February 23, 2014; and another written on February 20, 2014. I hope you can appreciate my growth in such a short space of time.
 
I am pleased to hear that you continue with the reading and essay workshop, which I would love to attend. But, I think, for now, I don't need to put more information in my head. At least until I’ve emptied it a little more. I am going to use my social network a little: I would like to ask you about essay methodology. I'm thinking of writing an essay, one of those where one pecks a lot and doesn't eat anything. I want to ask you about which structure of exhibition of ideas, you prefer, is the most appropriate, or the most used. This is a comparison of two possibilities. The first exposition consists on the presentation of a posture with pros and cons, followed by the other posture, with the same argumentative order, following the order of the respective pros and cons. The second is to follow a plot order, analyzing both positions simultaneously.
 
I will give you an outline because I am not sure I have explained myself well.

**EXHIBITION 1**
 
*Posture 1*

Argument a.  Argument b. Argument c. Argument d.

*Posture 2*

Argument a. Argument b. Argument c. Argument d. 
  
**EXHIBITION 2**
 
Posture 1 Argument a. Posture 2 Argument a.

Posture 1 Argument b. Posture 2 Argument b.

Posture 1 Argument c. Posture 2 Argument c.

Posture 1 Argument d. Posture 2 Argument d.
 
I will pass you some texts so you can give me some opinion or advice. The second thing I want to ask you about is about your language skills. I don't know if you can read comfortably in English, but if you could, I'd appreciate the time you would save me by not translating; either from Spanish to English or from English to Spanish. And if you couldn't, I would appreciate the Spanish/English lesson that I would learn with each translation. No worries. The water adapts.
 
Thank you for your opinion and advice in advance.
 
Regarding your thousand messes. If it's of any consolation, I also want to change the world. But I understand that it is not a task to perform alone. In fact, these are my reasons to study social networks, and to communicate by letter (to see if I stick the habit on someone...)
 
You will be pleased to know that there are a huge number of people without too much to do. More importantly, without much to do and eager of doing. For example, my mother had to leave her work (she got kicked out) and now she is at home, looking for what to do with her free time. I have invited her to sit down to write, but at first it is difficult and the computer does not help. I also offered her to come to Leuven for a few days, but it had some complications. The last thing I know about her is that she was going to attend a job interview, I still don't know how it has been. Talk and discuss the Parkinson's association case with her. My mother knows who you are and knows who I am (I hope). Do not have any objection, I will notify her in advance if you want. Send her a letter and ask for her help. My mother is a beautiful person, enormously hard-working and altruistic. She has a degree on social work and has worked within the health system for more than 5 years. I think it can help you and remove some of your workload. Also, I guarantee you would do her a huge favor. Last aspect, selfishly positive, you would have more time for Leibniz, and for me, which, I hope you already know, I am in a less hurry than Leibniz.

(Small parenthesis: There is a study by Granovetter [@granovetter1983strength] in which it shows that almost 70% of people find work through the social network. I leave it there)
 
Seriously Tomás, don't miss out and ask for help. This is the social network. What I want to "squeeze". Because together we can cover a lot and squeeze a lot. Anyway, the water adapts, to the dispersion or to the concentration, the important thing is to empty it, so that the glass does not overflow.
 
To conclude, I consider you to be the ideal person to debate different views on ethics and morals. At the moment, I am preparing a text on morality that I would like you to read in general. I will send it to you when you answer the questions about the language and the structure.
 
Tao,
 
Carlos

P.S. I keep waiting for your invitation to pass by and eat together one day. I know you are an excellent cook. (Don't forget that I have more patience than Leibniz. I am learning to wait).

I let you know that I have been touched reading “*Dear future ME*”^[[2014-02-24 From L. to herself]].

You have reached a conclusion that no one needed to explain to you. You have accepted yourself. You have assumed all your mistakes, not as mistakes, but as necessary consequences in the learning and development of your life and of the person you currently are. Without those mistakes, lessons, you couldn't have become who you are.

It is perfect, L. Beautiful that you love yourself, that you accept yourself.

Probably many of your problems have been automatically solved by writing that letter. The ones that don't, you know, you have friends to tell them about.
 
Regards
 
Carlos

Hello mother,
 
How is everything? I hope more or less well. I'm fine.
 
I would like to know how was the job interview. I have written a letter to T., my former philosophy teacher, offering him your help, since he is quite involved with an association of Parkinson's affected. In case you have time, it can be quite interesting for you.
 
I would also like to know what plans or ideas you have about the trip that I proposed to you. Neither money nor family are a real inconvenience for you to come. The money thing is ridiculous; and A. and D. have to wake up and get by themselves. I would like you to write to me about them and dad. How do you see them? What are they doing? And, how are they? Once you tell me I will write something especially for them.
 
Regards,
 
Carlos

## 2014-03-07 To F {-#toF20140307}

2014-03-07

Greetings F.,
 
I just meditated and I don't know if I see lighter or darker. But I am emptier. My interior is clearer.
 
First of all, thank you. Thank you for all that you have taught me and continue to teach me. Since the day I met you, every chat, conversation, or email with you has been very fruitful for me. The last lesson you have given me has been to recognize that lots of work remains to be done with humanity. Even so, we are still on the right track. Thank you.
 
I'm sorry to tell you this, it grieves me greatly, but lately you make me sad. I am sorry to see that the person T. introduced me at *El Gallinero* about 4 years ago (time flies, isn’t it?) Has changed so much. That person for whom I put on a shirt, to give a good image. That person that appeared in espadrilles, with a mane, earrings and white pants that looked like pajamas. T. incorruptible. Without prejudice, he accepted us and admired who we were and what we could be; not because of what we appeared to be. It didn't matter the attire if our spirit was on the path we had chosen, or that we still had to choose. Each his, his own way. Way to be discovered and traveled, which to this day we continue discovering and traveling.
 
I am sorry to tell you that you have disappointed me greatly. Seriously, I'm sorry. It was my fault, I admit it. For not being empty. For having expectations. Expectations about educated people, about wise people. To think that these would keep their humanity intact through the passing of the years.
 
At first, I thought about sending you a text full of authors and references, but, I suppose that like [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson#Comments_on_race), discoverer of DNA, the references and the previous and subsequent demonstrations do not have much depth in your iron spirit. Also, by the way, I don't want to give you any references: because I don't know them, because I don't have time to look for them, and because you could answer me with ten references in response to each one I put.
 
So I will try to appeal to your humanity, which, as a human being, I am sure you still have. As ignorant as I am, I will ask questions. I want to ask you if human beings do not deserve equality and respect just because they are human beings. If they do not deserve to be treated fairly, justly, because they belong to the human condition. If, due to their inherent and intrinsic human dignity, they do not deserve the love and appreciation of other people. If we should not fight to try to achieve equality, even if it is artificial and invented, but that allows all people to try to find their way without others putting obstacles in their way and prevent it. Even if we show that blacks are dumber, and that women write worse. Don't they both deserve to have the same opportunities to study or write? Aren’t they human beings too? Aren’t they people?
 
I will believe the lies of equality, if the consequences are positive for humanity. And I will forget the truths of the differences if they lead us to segregation and violence between people, between brothers. The world, like science, is built by people. And we all decide whether we want to live in a world where blacks are dumber and women write worse (even if it's true), or one where we are all equal and have access to the same opportunities in a fair and impartial way (even if we aren’t the same). Sometimes I need to lie to myself and fool myself. Then I empty myself and forgot about self-deception. I forget the truth. I give myself new opportunities. Unprejudiced.
 
I consider that segregation and prejudice are not beneficial for humanity, and cause behaviors guided by hatred and ignorance in human beings. On the contrary, curiosity, even if it kills cats, brings people closer to each other. Curiosity and knowledge prevent the development of prejudice and are medicine for racism. Respect and love are forged with trust and cooperation. Opportunities for learning and experiences are needed. It is essential to look into the unknown. Observe each situation with new eyes.
 
I think that people are in the world to help each other and not to trip us up. The person you are helping today may be vital to you in the future. It can be the fundamental help that removes the obstacle that you alone cannot move. I like to think that the human being has come this far for his ability to love, and not for his ability to destroy. For his altruism, for putting the common interest before his own. For focusing on others.

Blacks are black because you are white. Just as women are women because you are a man. I am trying to abandon my point of view centered on myself. Stop comparing myself with the world, taking as a reference my point of view, my characteristics, the person that I am. I don't want to compare, neither with me, nor between them, nor with anything. I want to take people as individual beings. What they are. Leave the categories, stereotypes and prejudices aside.
 
Thus, I want to empty myself and be able to fill myself over and over again. Be empty. Forget all the science and references. For or against equality. Run into the living beings of the planet, with each object and with each new experience free of past influences. As if it were the first time. New water over and over again. Trying that my only prejudice is lack of prejudices.
 
I have been educated as a Scout, and the motto “*Leave this world a little better than you found it.*" has made quite an impact on my personality. In part, that's why I'm sending you this letter.

I have no time left. Sorry Fernando.
 
As a last thought, appreciate what you have accomplished. It's easy to blame you, but I decided to breathe. From the hatred that your emails caused me at first, I have been able to pass to a deep sadness when I realized the transformation you have undergone these years. Now there is only left an infinite gratitude to the beautiful person who has caused me to write this letter.
 
Thank you very much F.
 
Carlos

## 2014-03-10 From Al. {-#fromal20140310}

2014-03-10

Dear Carlos,

Finally I venture to put into practice my gift for writing ... It is rare not to know about you for so long, and the fact that now I am writing a letter to put remedy to the situation. But well, everything be for knowing about you.

I suppose that living in another country you will be a little isolated from the latest news about your home country, but come on, it is not that it matters too much what is happening around here ... In Canary Islands we face the great oil titan, with no apparent possibilities of stopping it, as much as the government and the Canarian people have joined forces to stop it... [Repsol enters our coasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repsol#Canary_Islands), takes our oil (if there is any) and we are promised to become the new Dubai, but nobody believes it.

Without downplaying the above, I would like to tell you about myself.

"*I am a normal, simple boy, just looking to have fun and what comes up, for a sporadic relationship or... who knows if I can be the love of your life?*"

Well yes, although it seems funny, that's me, more normal every day, and with the strangest life... Sometimes I feel that the script of the things that happen to me is written by [Almodóvar]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Almod%C3%B3var). I began a romantic relationship on January 26, with a boy whom I hardly knew, but who, after crossing a couple of words in a shopping center, I went completely crazy for him, and I waited two months for him to return from his work in Switzerland. Once the relationship began, everything seemed to be going well, until for some reason of fate, I insisted that things were not going well, and I left him. After 5 days I regretted it, and I went back to him... But it's not what I expect from a relationship at all. Now on top of that it happens that I have met a Valladolid student of French Philology in Salamanca at the carnivals, with whom I have been madly amazed, but today he has returned to his life, and I really do not know whether to do something crazy and take a trip to the peninsula. Before that, I have to think what I do with my relationship, because things are not going well at all...

I think all of the above is due to a prolonged accumulation of lack of affection, and which now makes me give myself 100% with people who perhaps are not appreciating everything I have, and they only see me as a pretty face and a gaze that lately speaks by itself about sadness and depression.

You will have seen my photos with makeup, I suppose... They are the work of my "*boyfriend?*", in his determination (not rejected from my side) to make me some kind of a model. I don’t truly know if that image benefits me, given the encounters I have lately when facing people’s comments assuring that I am "*someone empty*". It’s is not that I care about what people think, because I know how I really am, but I feel a little bad ...

The degree in general is going quite well, although I can't really focus on my studies when so many things happen in my life. Next year I think I need a change, but I'm still afraid to leave the nest ... I don’t know what I will do, but it would be nice to finish my studies.

So, I can't think of anything else to tell you… I've enrolled into a scout group in Gran Canaria, and this year I'm going to present myself to *Ruta Siete* again.

I really don't know what I feel like doing this summer. The other day the movie [*Into The Wild*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)), reminded me a lot about you ... And now, I think I want to go to Alaska... Hahaha

And you what about?

How is your project going? Internships?

I look forward to your response!

Al.


## 2014-03-13 From my mother. {-#frommother20140313}

2014-03-13

Hi Carlos.

The interview went very well, I was selected, but it was not for a job, but to take a vocational training course for employment. I have already started it, last Thursday, and, although there are moments that seem a little heavy to me – it’s 5 hours daily without changing the subject and the first module is very theoretical and structured, based on laws and concepts, acronyms ... - has created many expectations for me.

As I told you in the previous letter, the trip was subject to the realization of the course, since attendance is compulsory, and does not allow absences, even if justified, of more than a variable percentage according to the module and its duration. If I miss, it hinders one from passing and going to the next, not achieving the official training, certification and qualification, valid for the entire EU. Passing the course gives you a professional certificate as a teacher of level three, which gives you access to teach for vocational trainings. So, the trip is postponed until the end of the course, on June 30.

What you are proposing to me about the Parkinson APARVAL Association, I made a contact years ago to work (because of a maternity leave from a social worker) and I was not selected. I would not mind collaborating with them, as I did with others (Aficrovall or Fundamay) but I promised to return to Fundamay when I could do it with continuity-stability. When the time comes, I will assess whether it is possible to collaborate with both. Anyway, if it is a specific collaboration, at a time or with a specific action, tell him because perhaps I can carry it out, without committing myself to something permanent or continuous that at this moment is not possible.

We have already reached the most important and difficult point to deal with, that of the family relationship. We are currently in a moment of crisis, between your father and I there are hardly any words of greeting. We are in a dynamic of wanting-not wanting, power-not power... Due to many misunderstandings and lived situations that have placed us in our point of view - partial- and lack of dialogue, difficult to solve when you are unmotivated and tired, entering and maintaining oneself in a dynamic of non-communication.

But this should not worry you, do not let it influence your daily activity, when you come and we have some time we can talk together, mediate and try to resolve, in case the same situation continues.

Your brothers are with the practices of the course that they are finishing, at the end of the month it closes. From that moment on, we’ll see what opportunities they have. A. wants to enroll in professional formation of sports activity, if he decides so, he should try it in Segovia and Ávila, where he did not want to go years ago. So, an important step for his training and future.

I have to go to the Social Security Institute to solve some things. I will continue telling you when I have receive your reply letter.

Kisses and a very strong and heartfelt hug.

E.
